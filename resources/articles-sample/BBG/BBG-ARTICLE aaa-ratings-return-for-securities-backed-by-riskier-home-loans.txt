Two ratings firms are assigning AAA ratings to bonds backed by new riskier home loans, one of the few times such securities have won top grades since the financial crisis, according to documents obtained by Bloomberg.Fitch Ratings and DBRS Inc. are giving the ratings to more than $210 million of bonds backed by loans made by Caliber Home Loans, a unit of Lone Star Funds, and by loans from Sterling Bank & Trust and LendSure Mortgage Corp. The bonds are partially backed by mortgages in which the lender verified a borrower’s income with bank statements rather than tax returns. Another ratings firm, Moody’s Investors Service, recently called out those types of mortgages as risky.Most of the loans backing the bond are not qualified mortgages, meaning they do not adhere to U.S. government guidelines designed to give borrowers extra protections against their lenders. Those guidelines include how much debt a borrower can have.
