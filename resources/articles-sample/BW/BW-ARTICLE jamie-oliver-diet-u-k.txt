Jamie Oliver doesn’t mince words: Britain, like America, is too fat.
So fat that he’s been waging a public war on sugar -- one that has Big Food up in arms. It all began in June 2015 when the rock-star chef walked into 10 Downing Street to meet  David Cameron, then British prime minister, and proposed a tax on sugary drinks like Coke and Pepsi.
“I might as well have wafted dog’s muck in front of everyone,” Oliver recalled. “He said, ‘Well I don’t really like a tax.’ ”
Seemingly against the odds, Oliver got his way, making the fifth-largest economy in the world the latest wealthy nation to combat obesity and the health problems that come with it. In March, then-Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne surprised health campaigners by announcing he would legislate to impose a tax that would raise 520 million pounds ($659 million) a year.
