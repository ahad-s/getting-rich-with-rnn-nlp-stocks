U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May said she’ll push for a “red, white and blue” tailor-made Brexit agreement that’s in Britain’s best interests as she negotiates the country’s departure from the European Union.
May, who is facing criticism from investors and some members of her Conservative Party for failing to provide details of her government’s plan to take the country out of the European Union, said she doesn’t recognize any of the labels that have so far been given to characterize the shape the negotiations may take.
