842613731,"consumers-grow-more-upbeat,-nudging-up-sales-at-retailers",wsj_398890753,2004-11-15,"With oil prices easing and the uncertainties of the election past, U.S. consumers show early signs of becoming more confident about the economic outlook.
The University of Michigan's consumer-sentiment index -- based on surveys conducted before and after the Nov. 2 election -- rose to a reading of 95.5 from 91.7 in October and 94.2 in September. In addition to the drop of oil prices below $50 a barrel and the resolution of a bitterly fought presidential campaign, the government reported recently that hiring in October was stronger than expected, all factors that should underpin confidence.
""Consumers will remain spending-minded,"" said Richard Curtin, the Michigan economist who oversees the confidence survey. He said the recent decline in oil prices was probably the key factor behind the improvement.
Households were spending-minded in October, though their pattern of spending showed signs of changing from the month before. The U.S. Commerce Department said retail sales in October rose 0.2% from September on a seasonally adjusted basis, after a 1.6% jump the month before. The back-to-back gains put household consumption on solid footing going into the holiday season.
One retailer that enjoyed steady gains in spending was Men's Wearhouse Inc., a Houston seller of men's suits with an average price of about $280. The retailer reported a hearty 8.9% increase in domestic same-store sales last month from a year earlier. ""Our business is kind of to the masses, to the middle-market kind of guy. I think he's doing fine,"" said Neill Davis, chief financial officer."

He briefly highlighted his administration's accomplishments, then added a bit of news: Maryland's unemployment rate had fallen to 4.6 percent, the lowest level in years and somewhat below the national average of 5 percent.

And quietly sitting at another table, nearly lost in the huge hotel ballroom, was that very candidate: Harford County Executive Eileen M. Rehrmann.
Schmoke followed Glendening at the microphone and noted that Rehrmann and a few other elected officials were in the audience. He also praised the state economy and added: ""This breakfast is also a tribute to our country.""

The unemployment rate edged up to 4.2% in January, its highest level since September 1999 but only a bit above the near-30-year low of 4% in December, the Department of Labor said Friday. In January, the labor pool expanded faster than the number of new jobs that were created.
Payrolls outside of farming jumped 268,000 in January, adjusted for seasonal variation, well above what economists expected, and a big improvement over the tiny increase of 19,000 jobs in December. That increase was revised down sharply from an original estimate of 105,000. The January data suggest that employment, especially in construction where 145,000 jobs were added, had been unusually depressed by bad weather in December.
The report was the first comprehensive look at the entire economy for January. Previous reports had found that the industrial sector's decline accelerated during the month, and the payroll report provided further confirmation. Manufacturing jobs sank by 65,000, bringing total losses in that sector to 254,000 since June. But employment in retail trade, government and other services rose 183,000.
""It's clear you have a dichotomy between manufacturing and the rest of the economy,"" said Michael Prell, an economic consultant in Arlington, Va., noting that service-sector employment would have been higher but for the loss of jobs at temporary-help agencies, many of which were actually at manufacturing companies."

830985624,the-great-terror;-a-massive-new-history-of-hitler's-tyranny.,wapo_409899125,2006-01-29,"Looking at the enormous -- and incessant -- tide of books and articles written about Hitler and the Third Reich, we may note an interesting discrepancy. The majority of non-German historians and authors have devoted and are still devoting their main interests to Hitler's war and crimes, to the second six years of the Reich, 1939- 45. The majority of German historians and authors have devoted their main interests to topics and themes about the first six years, 1933- 39. This is understandable. In 1939 Hitler chose war, with the results of total defeat for Germany and Germans. But what led up to that? What happened to the German people before that fatal turning point?
The Third Reich in Power is Richard J. Evans's attempt to answer many of those questions through historical synthesis. The second part of this British historian's planned three-volume history of Nazi Germany, it is crammed with information (data, statistics, official and private records and reminiscences), sustained by the author's knowledge of German and his acquaintance with all kinds of German sources, many of them relatively recent ones. This heavy volume amounts to something like a massive handbook of a very big subject. It consists of seven large parts, made up of four chapters each, moving from the history of the Nazi police state to that of propaganda, religion, artistic and intellectual life, economy and finance, class structure, Jews and finally ""The Road to War"" -- that is, Hitler's foreign policy.
Yet there are things wrong with both the content and the writing of this massive book. Its long chapters about economics, finance and nationalization of German industry, detailing their difficulties, miss the essence of Hitler's thinking. ""Why should I nationalize the industry?"" he once said. ""I shall nationalize the people"" -- which is what he did (alas, quite successfully). Compared to that, Evans's citing of the occasional private grumblings of industrialists such as Gustav Krupp are largely devoid of meaning.
His judgments are sometimes contradictory. On page 370, he writes that ""the economy was clearly in no shape to sustain a prolonged conflict in 1938-1939."" (""Clearly""? And did Hitler plan for ""a prolonged conflict""?) But on page 409, he states that ""the economy had recovered from the Depression faster than its counterparts in other countries. Germany's foreign debt had been stabilized, interest rates had fallen to half their 1932 level, the stock exchange had recovered from the Depression, the gross national product had risen by 81 per cent over the same period. . . . Inflation and unemployment had been conquered."" Another contradiction: ""Everything that happened in the Third Reich took place in this pervasive atmosphere of fear and terror, which never slackened and indeed became far more intense towards the end."" Yet on many other pages, Evans mentions umpteen examples of the regime relenting its pressures for tactical purposes (for example, before and during the 1936 Berlin Olympics).
This heavy book is chock-full with statistics. Yet there is no mention of such very telling numbers as the increase in German marriages from about 511,000 in 1932 to 611,000 in 1936; the jump from 921,000 births in 1932 to 1,280,000 in 1936, meaning that for every two children born in Germany in 1932, three were born just four years later; the fact that in 1938 and 1939, most marriages in all of Europe were registered in Germany, exceeding the numbers among even the prolific people of Eastern Europe; or the statistic that suicides committed by young people under 20 dropped by 80 percent (!) during the first six years of the Hitler regime -- all symptoms of a great and ominous rise of German national confidence."

Separately, the U.S. Labor Department reported that the number of workers filing first-time applications for unemployment benefits dropped by an unexpectedly steep 25,000 last week, a decline that may have been skewed by the holiday-shortened week.
The Conference Board, a private research group in New York, reported that its composite index of leading indicators fell by 0.1% to a reading of 115.6 in September, after August's 0.3% decline. The slightness of the declines in the past four months seems to argue against invoking the economists' rule of thumb that three consecutive declines in the index signal a recession.
""While the leading index is not yet signaling a downturn, the growth rate of the leading index has slowed,"" said Ken Goldstein, an economist with the Conference Board. Economic growth should continue, but more slowly than expected, he added. The index is designed to predict the economy's path during the next three to six months.
Oil prices have had a negative impact on the economy, but not enough to produce a broad spike in inflation. Recent hurricanes may also have held down economic activity, the Conference Board said."

Rates are still above the record low of 4.71 percent set in early December. They've been held around 5 percent by a Federal Reserve program to pump $1.25 trillion into mortgage-backed securities to try to keep home-loan rates low, making home buying more affordable.
On Wednesday, the Fed said it still expects to end the program as scheduled on March 31. However, the central bank did say that it remains open to changing the timetable if necessary.
The average rate on 15-year, fixed-rate mortgages fell slightly, to 4.39 percent from 4.40 percent. Rates on five-year, adjustable-rate mortgages averaged 4.25 percent, down from 4.27 percent. Rates on one-year ARMs dropped to 4.29 percent from 4.32 percent."

About the only bright spots the Fed found in the latest of its periodic nationwide surveys of business and banking conditions were growing orders for U.S. exports, a modest gain in new home building and a rush by homeowners to refinance their mortgages.
Otherwise, the president and Congress, who are under increasing pressure to take action to boost growth, can expect little help from natural economic forces until midyear, the survey indicated. Executives questioned by the Fed's 12 regional banks said they ""generally anticipate that economic conditions will improve by midyear.""
The year-end gain in housing found by the survey was mirrored in a Commerce Department report yesterday that showed housing starts rose 2.6 percent last month, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.103 million units. The December figure was 30 percent higher than last January's recession low, which amounted to an annual rate of only 847,000 units.
For all of 1991, however, housing starts totaled 1.015 million units, down nearly 15 percent from 1990, and the lowest figure since the end of World War II."

Valuations are historically high. In May and June, nearly two-thirds of the economic reports he tracks came in below the consensus forecast. Most troubling, inflation barometers are losing momentum, and his calculations hint earnings growth may already have peaked. These findings would shock the smiling bulls.

Much of the difference comes down to how the employment surveys are conducted and the problems that stem from producing estimates so quickly after the month ends.
The Labor Department's report is drawn from two separate surveys, one looking at workers in households (to determine the unemployment rate, among other measures) and the other looking at payrolls for businesses (to provide figures on job creation). They don't always match up because they are based on different samples, but in the long run they tend to line up fairly closely. The December payroll survey released Friday showed a modest gain of 103,000 jobs. But the prior two months were revised up by 70,000 jobs. The surprisingly weak November figure moved from a gain of 39,000 jobs, as reported last month, to a gain of 71,000 jobs.
Why such a large jump in the revision? The estimates for job creation are drawn from a fairly large sample size. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, a unit of the Labor Department, samples about 140,000 businesses and government agencies representing roughly 410,000 work sites.
But all the surveys don't come back in time for the government to release its initial estimate, usually on the first Friday of the next month. As more results come in, the estimates become more reliable. Labor updates data for the prior two months before considering it final. It also does annual revisions of those figures to account for the creation of new businesses -- a development that is hard to measure during turning points in the economy as companies are shutting down or starting up."

We are all aware of the weakness that permeated the economy and how the Federal Reserve responded to that weakness during the year. Initially, an economic rebound was anticipated, but when one failed to develop, the Fed responded with dramatic cuts in short-term â€œadministeredâ€ù ratesâ€”the discount rate and the federal funds rateâ€”which the Fed directly controls.
As a result of these cuts, two-thirds or more of the decline in the short rates occurred in the second half of the year, with most of that decline occurring in November and December. Consequently, the yield curve, as measured from either short rates or from the two-year note out to the 30-year bond, widened to record levels. For example, the Treasury yield curve (two-year note to the 30-year bond) began the year at a spread of -1-102 basis points and closed at +266 basis points. At midyear, the curve was only +146 and by December had widened to a high of +276 basis points.
However, since the deficit continues to grow, the overall interest cost of the debt continued to rise. To be more correct on this point, if interest rates had not declined so much, and the curve had not taken on such a positive shape, the interest cost for financing the debt would have been probably as much as one-third higher.
Another feature of last yearâ€™s market was its ability to finance such a huge amount of debt at such modest interest rates. True, the anemic economy and the Fed helped a great deal, but when one considers the volume of financing, it is quite incredible."

Would it were so. We believe that 2009 will be tougher than many anticipate.
We enter the new year grappling with the most serious global economic and financial crisis since the Great Depression. The U.S. economy is, at best, halfway through a recession that began in December 2007 and will prove the longest and most severe of the postwar period. Credit losses of close to $3 trillion are leaving the U.S. banking and financial system insolvent. And the credit crunch will persist as households, financial firms and corporations with high debt ratios and solvency problems undergo a sharp deleveraging process.
Worse, all of the world's advanced economies are in recession. Many emerging markets, including China, face the threat of a hard landing. Some fear that these conditions will produce a dangerous spike in inflation, but the greater risk is for a kind of global ""stag-deflation"": a toxic combination of economic stagnation, recession and falling prices. We're likely to see vulnerable European markets (Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria), key Latin American markets (Argentina, Venezuela, Ecuador and Mexico), Asian countries (Pakistan, Indonesia and South Korea), and countries like Russia, Ukraine and the Baltic states facing severe financial pressure.
Policy remedies will have limited effect as insolvency problems constrain the effectiveness of monetary stimulus, and the risk of rising interest rates (following the issuance of a wave of public debt) erodes the growth effects of fiscal stimulus packages. Only when insolvent banks are shut down, others are cleaned up, and the debt level of insolvent households is reduced will conditions ease. Between now and then, we can expect further downside risks to equity markets and other risky assets, given the likelihood that markets will continue to be jolted by worse-than-expected financial news.
The U.S. twin fiscal and current-account deficits will rise over the next two years as the country runs trillion dollar-plus fiscal deficits. We're all aware that foreign actors have financed most of this debt over the past several years. During the 1980s, the U.S. also faced the burdens of twin deficits, but relied on financing from key strategic partners like Japan and Germany. This time, the situation is more worrisome because today's financing comes not from U.S. allies, but from strategic rivals like Russia, China and a number of relatively unstable petrostates. This leaves the U.S. perilously dependent on the kindness of strangers."

Meanwhile, Senate Democratic leaders said yesterday they still have no deal to move the nominations to a floor vote. Sen.

830985532,funds-that-show-power-of-just-one,wapo_408358592,1998-04-12,"As the Dow Jones industrial average hurtles toward 10,000, putting journalists in a quandary about whether to use a comma, investors are pouring more and more money into mutual funds -- a record $37.5 billion in net new cash in March. In 1980, fund investments totaled $100 billion in 12 million accounts; today, $5 trillion in 170 million accounts.
Still, the majority of Americans have exactly zero dollars invested in the stock market. Some of them simply don't have the money, but many others are confused and scared, and don't know where to begin. They think they need special expertise, and they worry about being burned by unscrupulous brokers or stock manipulators. That's a shame, considering how easy it has become to own stocks and how fair and efficient our markets are.
The best way to get into the stock market is to buy shares in an equity mutual fund, which is a portfolio of stocks chosen by a professional manager. When you own a share in a fund, you own pieces of all the stocks in the portfolio. While I think it's a good idea to own three or four funds, it's possible -- even prudent -- to own just one. But which fund? That is this week's question, both for investment novices and for more seasoned mavens who want to ponder an interesting intellectual question.
Here is what I want in just-one-fund: relatively low risk; broad exposure to stocks, including at least a few international ones; strong, consistent performance; and a seasoned manager. I'd like to beat the market, but with few unsettling dips. The ideal fund would not be too big. New research from Morningstar Mutual Funds shows that returns decline as oversized large-cap funds (but, curiously, not small-cap funds) grow to behemoths. Also, expenses should be reasonable, and turnover (which boosts tax bills) should be relatively low.
One of the few funds that meets these criteria is Dreyfus Disciplined Stock (1-800-645-6561), which has two of my favorite words in its title. The manager, Bert Mullins, has been running the fund since it began 10 years ago under the aegis of Mellon Bank Corp., a conservative Pittsburgh-based institution that merged recently with Dreyfus. Mellon had only a few funds, which were excellent but poorly marketed. Dreyfus had lots of funds, many of which were not stellar performers but were brilliantly sold. It was a match made in Wall Street heaven."

Spending on government programs will increase by 22 percent from 1999 to 2003 in inflation-adjusted dollars, according to the analysis by The Washington Post and vetted by budget experts in both parties.
The president's 2003 budget proposals, combined with spending approved in the first year of his administration and the last two years of the Clinton administration, dwarf the spending increase from any four-year period since President Lyndon Johnson fought the Vietnam War while launching a war on poverty. Other periods of substantial increases in domestic spending, including the Nixon and Carter administrations, were accompanied by cuts in military spending. President Ronald Reagan boosted money for the mili- tary while trimming the domestic budget.
In the short term, the latest spending hike is one factor helping to pull the nation out of recession.

In a highly anticipated speech on monetary policy Friday, the Federal Reserve chairman argued that the Fed's easy-money policies were helping the weak economy and laid the groundwork for more action.
But economists and central bankers wondered more openly than usual if the Fed had the tools to fix the problems of the day and expressed frustration that four years of super low interest rates and extraordinary money-pumping by the Fed hadn't done more to spur the slow-moving economy.
""Why is it that we've had such incredibly accommodative monetary policy for so long and we've had so little growth?"" Donald Kohn, a Brookings Institution scholar, asked from the audience after a panel discussion here Saturday.
It was a striking question because Mr. Kohn is a former vice chairman of the Fed and was Mr. Bernanke's right-hand man during the financial crisis.

The broader market did a bit better, but with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gaining 3%, it, too, drew yawns rather than applause.
But even as the market treaded water, corporate profits grew quickly. Company analysts polled by Reuters Estimates predict that earnings for companies in the S&P 500 increased 13.6% in 2005. Because the S&P 500 went up less than its earnings, it's price/earnings ratio slipped. On Friday, the S&P 500 closed at 16.4 times 2005 earnings. It finished 2004 at 18 times that year's earnings.

Why this gloomy analysis now? Because three troubling trend lines are coming together. First, it's increasingly clear that the tax-cut bill recently passed by Congress and signed by President Bush, while reasonable enough at its advertised size, has enough tricks and omissions in its details that its true effect on the budget is understated, perhaps by hundreds of billions of dollars.
Second, Congress and the administration have put the tax cut within a 10-year spending plan that an optimist would call extremely ambitious -- and a skeptic would call wholly unrealistic. It anticipates Congress somehow will keep spending increases for the next decade to roughly half the average of the last couple of years -- and that the Bush administration won't weigh in with big new defense-spending or substantial emergency-spending requests.

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--U.S. stocks are likely to extend their Friday tumble when the market opens on Monday, while Treasurys and the U.S. Dollar are expected to rise, as continuing violence in Egypt over the weekend spurs investors to seek safe haven assets.
The events in Egypt have already prompted a rise in Treasury prices, a move that also benefited the dollar. Meanwhile, stock prices have fallen amid concern the violence in Egypt could spread to other countries in the Middle East or shut down the Suez Canal, potentially wreaking havoc on oil prices.
On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 166.13 points, or 1.4%, to 11823.70, its largest one-day drop in more than two months.

Market volatility skyrocketed on Friday, sending the CBOE Volatility Index up 24% amid investor anxiety. The VIX is at levels unseen since Dec. 2.
Investors nervous about instability gripping Egypt drove Middle Eastern stocks down sharply Sunday as markets reopened following a weekend of violent protests. The losses, led by a drop of more than 4% in regional business hub Dubai, reflect concerns the unrest that has roiled the Arab world's most populous country and nearby Tunisia could spread, jeopardizing an economic recovery across the region.

The dollar's slump aroused renewed concern that foreign investors may cut back on their purchases of dollar-denominated investments at a time when the U.S. is addicted to massive infusions of foreign funds. In addition, traders fear the falling dollar, which makes imported goods more expensive, will intensify pressures for higher inflation and increased interest rates.
If the dollar continues to fall sharply, the Federal Reserve might react by tightening credit slightly, raising short-term interest rates, analysts say. But most agree that a credit-tightening move isn't likely anytime soon because that could damage the economy and place additional strains on the banking system.

The economy as a whole has been expanding for a year, but mostly at a snail's pace and far more slowly than is normal in the early stages of a business-cycle upswing. The unemployment rate hangs stubbornly above 7%, higher than when the recovery began. And new-home starts, a rare bright spot during most of 1991 and early this year, fell sharply in April.
Help is clearly needed, but is any on the way? Perhaps. A likely source, as important as it is unexciting: capital spending.
Such outlays, typically for new plant and equipment, tend to lag behind the economy as a whole. The Commerce Department, in fact, classifies plant-and-equipment spending, adjusted for inflation, as a lagging economic indicator at points in the business cycle when, as now, the economy is emerging from a slump. Such spending invariably fell, for example, in the early months of four other recoveries since 1969.
This pattern has occurred again in the current recovery. In last year's second quarter, as the recovery was just beginning to take hold, plant-and-equipment spending fell to an annual rate of some $487 billion, in terms of the 1987 dollar's buying power; this was $9 billion less than in the previous quarter. But more recently an impressive climb has taken place: The spending level recently moved above $525 billion.
Further substantial increases seem probable. Most forecasters look for the recovery to persist and broaden in coming months. In the process, businesses will need to expand their facilities appreciably. Indeed, the task could become urgent if the recovery should prove unexpectedly brisk. After much restructuring and many plant closings, manufacturers already are using nearly 80% of their capacity."

The Federal Reserve System will keep a tight grip on credit in coming months to underscore its determination to hold the line on inflation, these analysts said. Furthermore, they said, businesses will borrow heavily to finance new equipment and the construction of new plants.
""We can't see a fundamental turn in interest rates without an abatement in the explosion"" of business borrowing, said Wayne Lyski, a vice president of Alliance Capital Management Co., an investment manager. And that isn't likely, he contended. ""The single biggest negative in the bond market continues to be an escalation in credit demands.""
Many investors have been hoping that slower economic growth will lead to less borrowing and lower interest rates. But those hopes are misplaced, argued Edward Yardeni, senior vice president and economist of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.

The latest monthly survey by the National Association of Purchasing Management found that production and new order rates slowed from the previous month, but employment rose at the strongest rate in the past 12 months.
""November's robust showing underscores the strength remaining in the economy as it entered the seventh year of recovery,"" said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the group's national business survey committee.
Coming on the heels of the Labor Department's unexpectedly strong November job growth report on Friday, the purchasers' survey could exacerbate concern that the economy isn't cooling down as neatly or as notably as many economists thought. A too-strong economy raises worries that the Federal Reserve Board may curb credit in an effort to head off worrisome inflation.
The economy has been giving some mixed signals lately, and the purchasers' report also contains some disparate views. Mr. Bretz noted that the survey displayed ""some signs of softening, particularly in the export order growth rate.""

The Fed said nothing to dissuade financial markets from anticipating another quarter-point rate increase before year end.
The Fed's campaign to lift interest rates is intended not to slow the economy, but to raise rates from emergency lows in order to avoid creating an inflation problem in the future. The target on the federal-funds rate, at which banks lend to each other overnight, was chopped to a 45-year-low of 1% in mid-2003 from 6.5% at the start of 200. With much advance warning, the Fed began lifting rates in June.
The economy now appears to have pulled out of a ""soft patch"" -- as Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has put it -- that was largely the result of higher oil prices. After substantial hesitation, employers are hiring, adding more than one million jobs since the low point in August 2003, though payrolls remain one million shy of the March 2001 peak. Following disappointing second-quarter growth of 2.8%, the U.S. economy now is expanding at better than 3.5%, perhaps as strong as 4%, private economists estimate.
But recent declines in long-term bond yields suggest the bond market may not be as optimistic. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.05% yesterday, well below June's 4.87%; yields fall as bond prices rise. Stocks rallied.

Failure to enact the agreement ""would, in my estimation, be a grave mistake,"" the Fed chairman said.
The greenback would be hurt by softer U.S. interest rates because lower yields make dollar-denominated investments less attractive to investors. But yesterday's losses were limited because the dollar neared its record low against the mark and because market participants doubted that Mr. Greenspan would have his way. Passage of the budget agreement by the Senate and House is uncertain, and bond investors may not take as sanguine a view of the proposed spending cuts and tax increases as the Fed chief has.
The budget accord aims to take $40.1 billion off the federal budget deficit in fiscal 1991, and $500 billion over five years, through a combination of tax increases and spending cuts.

He turned out to be wrong, but top U.S. economists are now hotly debating whether his ideas apply today, and if so what to do about it.
The self-appointed heir to Mr. Hansen's theory is Lawrence Summers, the former top economic adviser to President Barack Obama, who points to nagging sluggish U.S. growth since the bursting of the tech bubble in 2000 and proposes more aggressive government spending.
Mr. Summers first raised the secular stagnation idea in November and pressed his argument during three days of meetings this past weekend.

As the prices of long-term Treasury bonds have eroded during the past month the yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30year bond has risen to 7.78% from 7.39%. A yield of 7.8%, some analysts suggest, may be enough to divert investors away from stocks' uncertain prospects of eventually fatter corporate profits and direct them back to bonds as a competitive investment.
Bond prices slipped yesterday amid confusion about the Treasury's intentions for financing the federal debt. Yesterday, Budget Director Richard Darman told a congressional committee that the administration's budget proposal assumes that the Treasury will place less emphasis on the 30-year bond as a financing instrument than in the past. But he later was quoted as saying that a decision hasn't been made on the amount of 30-year bonds to be sold at next month's refunding auction."

""While we have made progress, we have further to go,"" Ms. Yellen said of the Fed's role in helping the economy when President Barack Obama named her as his pick last month.

The Fed's dual mandate was established in 1977, when Congress wrote into the Federal Reserve Act that the central bank must pursue both maximum employment and stable prices.
It is a controversial requirement in political circles because some Republicans think the employment component has taken the Fed's focus off the more important and achievable mission of low inflation.

Many economists, including those at the Federal Reserve, aren't worried -- yet. But there have been confusing warning signs in recent weeks. Core inflation, the prices consumers pay for goods and services, excluding food and energy, increased 0.5% in both January and February. Hourly earnings jumped 0.5% in March and are running at a 4% annual rate of increase for the first three months of the year.
It's a fluke, say Federal Reserve officials, who believe that the economy is too soft to support a round of big price increases. But that view may be rattled tomorrow and Friday, when the Labor Department releases new data on movement on the producer price and consumer price indexes in March. If the numbers show another solid increase in prices, it could incite much more serious worries about inflation.
Low inflation has been one of the bittersweet benefits of this unusually sluggish recovery. Demand hasn't been strong enough to allow retailers and producers to up the prices of goods. And a weak labor market has kept wages relatively subdued. As a result, consumer prices edged up their smallest amount in six years during 1992.
But now that the economy is showing signs of firming, some businesses are trying to push through price increases, hoping the market will finally bear it.

Social Security and Medicare have been the means. The elderly had a poverty rate of 25 percent in the late 1960s. It is half that now, and lower than the rate for the society as a whole, thanks mainly to increased Social Security benefits. In addition, thanks to Medicare, the elderly are now the group in society with the most comprehensive health insurance.
The problem with these programs is not the benefits they confer, but the cost. They have come to dominate, if not the government itself, most certainly its budget. Aiding the elderly is now the main thing that the federal government does; such aid accounts for fully half the budget for other than interest on the debt and defense. The share can only rise as the baby boomers retire in the years ahead - but the money to support such an expansion is not in sight.
The taxes presently in place won't cover projected Social Security costs when the boomers retire early in the next century. The Medicare trust fund will be exhausted even earlier. To protect the long-term integrity of both, Congress will sooner or later have to raise taxes or cut costs; if costs, it ought to begin a gradual process now.
The trust funds are one source of pressure on the elder-programs; the other is the budget deficit. The president and Congress took a welcome step toward reducing it last year; they need to do more. A favorite target of budget-cutters is the spending category called entitlements. Their semi-automatic growth each year is taken as proof of the indiscipline the budget-cutters mean to cure. Which is fine, but it, too, is a euphemism. Entitlements turn out to be 60 percent aid to the elderly by another name. Congress keeps threatening to impose entitlement caps in the abstract, and now there is also an entitlements commission. But entitlement-cutting is mainly a way of discussing in general and in code a subject that the politicians would do better to discuss directly.
Thus a leading budget-cutting proposal now making the rounds is to cut the cost of entitlements across the board by means-testing them. Among the proponents is the budget-balancing group called the Concord Coalition. The idea is that a hard-pressed government has no business paying benefits (or asking middle-income taxpayers to finance benefits) for people above certain income cutoffs. For recipients with incomes above, say, $40,000 a year, entitlements (including Social Security benefits and the insurance value of Medicare) would be progressively reduced, though never wiped out entirely."

""The world economy is now entering a major downturn in the face of the most dangerous shock in mature financial markets since the 1930s,"" the IMF said Wednesday in its World Economic Outlook.
Just a few months after upgrading its global forecasts, the IMF is now ratcheting down its expectations for the economy this year and into 2009.
The world economy is now expected to expand at a 3.9% pace in 2008, down from the estimate of 4.1% in July. The 2009 forecast was slashed from 3.9% to 3%, which would be the weakest level since 2002 and near the threshold of what the IMF considers a global recession.
While the IMF still expects a recovery to begin late next year, it warned there are ""considerable downside risks"" to that scenario, which assumes U.S. and European governments will succeed in their efforts to stabilize markets."

The dollar was modestly weaker against most major currencies as some investors sold the U.S. currency ahead of the release of today's keenly awaited March trade-deficit data.
Falling Treasury yields and U.S. equities added to the pressure on the currency, which still seems to be searching for a clear direction. The session's main winner was the euro, which strengthened against the dollar, yen and sterling, as traders took profits after driving the common currency lower in recent days.
In late New York trading, the euro was at $1.2872, up from $1.2843 late Monday. The dollar weakened to 105.59 yen from 105.65 yen and to 1.2015 Swiss francs from 1.2055 francs. The pound fell to $1.8822 from $1.8832 on weak overnight data, while the euro moved to 135.88 yen from 135.66 yen.
There were no major U.S. economic reports. The trade-deficit numbers could shake up the market in early New York trading today. The consensus of a Dow Jones Newswires and CNBC survey is that the deficit widened slightly to $61.5 billion in March, from February's record $61 billion."

To many, it looked that way for the dollar late last month, when the U.S. currency staged a brief comeback after its long and steep decline against the world's other currencies, especially the euro. The dollar at one point climbed to $1.2338 to the euro from an all-time low of $1.2897, set earlier in January.
Many sages said the time was just ripe for a brief dollar recovery and that the dollar's downward creep would continue soon afterward. The dollar's brief boost, they say, was simply caused by European officials jawboning in its favor, the Federal Reserve hinting that U.S. interest rates could be headed higher and finance officials from the Group of Seven industrialized nations preparing for their meeting this weekend.
Indeed, that consensus appeared to be right when the dollar's decline started again a little less than two weeks ago. In late New York trading yesterday, the euro was changing hands at $1.2545, less than 3% below its record high. After all, ""nothing much has changed in underlying fundamentals,"" says Carl Weinberg, chief economist at consulting firm High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y.

Until a report in The Wall Street Journal this week, financial markets had expected the Fed to declare the risks of inflation and recession about equal.

From New York to Philadelphia, refineries that turn oil into gasoline have been idled or shut permanently because their owners are losing money on them. Sunoco Inc. is expected to close the region's largest refinery in July, taking another 335,000 barrels per day in production capacity off the market.
The East Coast refineries are getting squeezed by the soaring cost of crude oil, the major component in gasoline. The cost of oil has jumped in the past year due to global economic growth and rising tensions between Western nations and Iran, a major producer. Refineries haven't been able to increase their own prices enough to compensate.
The government said Friday that the increase in gas prices had contributed to a 0.4% overall increase in consumer prices in February. Prices at the pump averaged $3.831 a gallon on Friday, according to the AAA, formerly known as the American Automobile Association.

This week, Wal-Mart Stores said it expects food deflation to abate this year and Winn-Dixie forecast outright inflation in the second quarter. Friday's consumer-price index data for January could add to the evidence.
This year could be more complicated than usual. First, the initial round of food inflation is likely to occur in perishables such as milk, whose price has already rebounded in recent months. Just as some grocers saw perishables volumes rise last year when prices fell, the reverse could be true if prices rise.
Second, packaged-food prices could keep falling for some time. Even if raw ingredient costs begin to rise, many manufacturers have locked in lower raw-material prices using hedges. Meredith Adler of Barclays Capital estimates packaged food accounts for 40% of the average grocer's revenue.

Now China's thriving economy has made it possible for people like Chen, a 67-year-old semi-retired aerospace industry official, to plop down 1,168 yuan, or $170, for a bottle of liquor at a branch of a French ""hypermarket"" chain.
""It's not that expensive for ordinary Chinese people now,"" he said, adding that he planned to serve Johnnie Walker Green Label to guests he was expecting to share moon cakes with during last weekend's mid-autumn festival.
""As Chinese society has developed and opened up, people have a better appreciation of imported liquor,"" said Chen, who used to buy the traditional Chinese stiff drink known as maotai. ""When you choose a gift, other people will look at it and if it is brand stuff they will feel respected because you chose it for them."""

Economic data released Thursday show the stress in the economy leading up to the crisis and hint at how it may have gotten worse since. Demand for manufactured goods fell sharply in August as new- home sales slid to their lowest monthly level in 17 years. And in the week ended Sept. 20, new unemployment filings hit the highest level since just after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
U.S. leaders hope the government's massive interventions, plus plans for a big bailout now being negotiated, will soften the blow. The economy also is running on a reassuring quarter-century path of mostly sustained growth that could reassert itself.
But ripple effects from a worsening credit crunch are already making their way from Wall Street to Main Street. General Electric Co. kicked off what could be a parade of profit warnings on Thursday. Many companies have seen their borrowing costs rise in the short-term commercial-paper market.
History, and a close look at recent data, suggest the economy could travel any of four possible routes through the financial crunch. The most likely scenario is a recession marked by a protracted period of tight credit. But three other scenarios -- a dangerous run on the dollar, Japan-style deflation or surprising economic resilience -- are also within the realm of possibility."

The Labor Department also reported that consumer prices rose 0.5 percent last month, the biggest monthly rise in two years. However, experts said the increase did not signal an acceleration of inflation.
The report on December's trade balance and other recent data on the fourth quarter have been considerably stronger than expected.

After a worrisome rise in prices in the first four months of the year, recent evidence suggests inflation is again in check. The Labor Department said its consumer price index rose a tiny 0.1% in July. The index didn't change in June and increased only 0.1% in May.
Analysts have been watching closely for signs of problem inflation for a hint as to whether the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates. Most have been encouraged that the recent spate of good pricing news, coupled with signs that the economy is growing slowly, will keep the Fed's hands off the interest-rate lever.
The consumer price report comes on top of other encouraging inflation news. Producer prices in July fell, labor costs rose at a slow pace and a report on manufacturers suggested that inflation pressures were diminishing in the industrial sector as well.
""This enhances the feeling that a surge in prices at the beginning of the year was seasonal"" and couldn't be sustained because of sluggish economic activity, said Samuel Kahan, chief economist of Fuji Securities in Chicago."

The tax question is the one that most worries economists. On one hand, higher taxes could slow down the economy by taking money out of the pockets of consumers.

The U.S. and U.K. appear to have gotten something right, while the eurozone and Japan have fumbled. Unemployment rates after the crisis peaked at 10% in the U.S. and 8.5% in the U.K., and are down to 5.8% and 6%, respectively. The eurozone rate has climbed in the past few years to 11.5%, while Japan's economy has fallen back into recession.
The American and British central banks embraced aggressive easy-money policies early on. Japan lurched toward consumption-tax increases to restrain budget deficits, while Europe moved slowly in addressing weaknesses in banks and stuck to a course of fiscal austerity.
Here are three lessons from this inadvertent experiment in post-crisis policy-making:
Quantitative easing helps address a long-standing economic riddle. What can central banks do to help the economy after short-term rates hit the ""zero lower bound?"" When rates are near zero, central banks lose a tool typically employed when the economy is weak: short-term interest-rate cuts. Rate cuts spur borrowing, spending and investment, helping to smooth out the economic cycle by bringing forward activity from a more optimistic future during depressed times."

But that was mere prelude to the federal budget President Clinton unveiled yesterday. Monica may yet be remembered as the face that launched a thousand new federal programs.
Congress should call it the Lewinsky budget. The President's proposals for fiscal year 2000 represent a grab-bag bonanza that can only be explained as an attempt to repay the liberal Democrats in Congress who've stood by Mr. Clinton through scandal and impeachment.
And what a reward it is: $1.833 trillion in revenue, which adds up to the greatest Beltway tax windfall in American peacetime history -- and all of it to be divvied up and passed around by politicians! The only losers are taxpayers, who under Mr. Clinton's proposal will have to ante up 20.7% of the whole economy to the feds. The era of big government is not over; the President has been born again as a tax-and-spend liberal.
Just for reference: Only once this century has the U.S. government sucked up this much tax money, in 1944, when it took in 20.9% of the economy to fight Hitler and Tojo. But just one year later, in 1945, the tax take had fallen to 20.4% of GDP. Mr. Clinton now wants federal taxation to claim more of the economy than it did during the height of the Korean War (19% in 1952), Vietnam (19.7% in 1969) and the Cold War (19.7% of 1981). He is presiding, and intentionally so, over the only peacetime era in American history when taxes have gone up.
It's this fabulous rush of revenues -- and not spending cuts -- that is mainly responsible for federal surpluses as far as the eye can see. From 1997 to 1998 alone, revenues climbed by $143 billion, or 9%, triple the rate of inflation. That followed a jackpot increase of $126.2 billion, or 8.7%, from 1996 to 1997."

Just a few days ago, Mr. Greenspan was under pressure from the financial markets to increase interest rates and prove his willingness to fight inflation. But by yesterday, the focus had changed dramatically. After Monday's unprecedented market crash, traders and analysts were calling on the central bank to ease credit to avoid recession.
""I think Greenspan is the only candidate for restoring the confidence of the markets,"" said Jerry Jordan, the chief economist at First Interstate Bank Corp. ""It's the chairman of the Fed, when it comes down to it, who pulls the levers.""
Whether Mr. Greenspan is up to that task remains to be seen. He tried to calm markets yesterday with a one-sentence statement signaling the Fed's switch from an anti-inflation to an anti-recession policy. It said: ""The Federal Reserve, consistent with its responsibilities as the nation's central bank, affirmed today its readiness to serve as a source of liquidity to support the economic and financial system.""
The Federal Reserve quickly backed up its statement with action, driving the federal funds rate down to about 6 3/4% late in the day from more than 7 1/2% Monday. ""I think that speaks for itself,"" said a senior administration official when asked if the Fed had eased credit.

Similarly, sales in Rocky Mountain states were boosted by workers' confidence in some of their dominant industries, such as New Mexico's defense contractors.

The dollar tripped first in what traders said was a reaction to the artificially strong demand for the currency in the closing days of 1988. The weaker dollar, coupled with a report that indicated the economy remains strong in the face of rising short-term interest rates, sent bond prices sprawling. And after that the fall in stock prices was almost anti-climactic.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated 23.93 to 2144.64 after being off nearly 40 points early in the afternoon. Computer-generated trading fueled much of the decline.
But analysts cautioned that yesterday's price action doesn't necessarily mean the financial markets have nowhere to go but down in 1989. ""I think there's less here than meets the eye,"" said Peter Canelo, a portfolio strategist at Bear Stearns. ""I don't think there's a clear direction on the economy, and there isn't any conviction about interest rates.""
As 1988 drew to an end, investors were looking for signs that the economy is slowing in reaction to the Federal Reserve's steady effort to drive interest rates higher. Instead, the early evidence points to a stronger than expected economy in December that will require even more interest rate discipline. That hurts bond prices in the short run and increases the chances that when the economy does slow it could do so abruptly, perhaps falling into recession. A sharp slowdown would undermine corporate profits, the main prop for stock prices."

Most analysts have argued that the Asian financial crisis was beginning to rein in the galloping U.S. economy to a more manageable trot. But in the government's first official look at January economic activity, the Labor Department said Friday that nonfarm businesses added 358,000 workers to their payrolls. That was slightly more than were generated in December's robust job market and well above the healthy 267,000 average monthly rise through 1997.
The employment report also showed how the rising economic tide is lifting more and more boats, with joblessness falling sharply even among high-school dropouts. For the first time, the Labor Department started reporting employment data by level of education, and said the unemployment rate for people without high-school diplomas fell to 7.2% last month from 8.9% a year earlier. Even so, the numbers confirmed that education still matters a lot: the unemployment rate for college graduates was a minuscule 1.9% last month, down from 2.1% a year earlier. (The department had been collecting these figures in the past, but not posting them.)
The January unemployment rate for all workers stayed at the same 4.7% of the work force reported in December. The low jobless level continued to give workers more bargaining power, as average hourly earnings rose by four cents, to $12.51. During the past year, wages rose 3.8%, or about twice the inflation rate. The figures are adjusted for seasonal factors.
In contrast, other data released recently indicate some sort of economic slowdown. The monthly survey of manufacturers' purchasing managers released last week showed some decline in business, as did the government's report on factory orders in December. Consumer confidence is reported to have dropped sharply in January. Anecdotal evidence -- such as disappointing profit reports and job cuts at blue-chip companies -- has added to the perception of softening. Policymakers have assumed some easing from last year's torrid growth rate was imminent. That was a big reason the Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady last week."

Chain stores have stumbled like Marley's ghost through the entire year, with Caldor, Bradlees and Kmart all losing ground. In December alone, big companies such as Reebok, Advanced Micro Devices, Office Depot, Best Buy and Georgia-Pacific hit 52-week lows.
Moreover, money managers with diversified portfolios find themselves struggling to keep pace with the blistering pace set by the major market indexes, and small stocks have been market laggards.

The Fed is under pressure to cut short-term rates further in response to what is now widely regarded as a recession. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is believed to have been given leeway to reduce rates before the Fed's policy committee convenes again in about two weeks. But internal objections could dissuade him from doing so."

As economist Larry Kudlow points out, we are now officially in a private-sector recession (two straight quarters of no growth in the economy outside of government). A weak economy in 2002 will mean major and potentially catastrophic GOP losses at the polls in the crucial midterm elections.
Yet ever since the passage of the president's tax cut back in June, the GOP's legislative momentum has slammed nose first into a concrete wall erected by Tom Daschle and Dick Gephardt. Virtually every bill that now is speeding through Congress is a growth depressant. The legislative docket is filled with financially bearish legislation -- to wit, the patients' bill of rights (which will cause a rash of lawsuits and enrich the trial lawyers); the Medicare prescription drug benefit (which could cost taxpayers $300 billion over the next 10 years); the farm bill (which would give away record subsidies to the agri-business industry); and the appropriations bills (that could allow spending to grow by 8% or 9% this year). President Bush should announce that he will veto any or all of these until the economy recovers.
This is America's first New Economy recession. American investors, of all incomes, have lost an unprecedented $4 to $5 trillion in wealth in the past 18 months. There's no reassuring market signal that these losses will be recouped anytime soon and there's certainly little federal action to revive growth. These enormous wealth losses have not yet punctured consumer confidence or spending, and they have not caused many net job losses. Nor have real estate values taken a hit. Not yet, at least.
We are surfing uncharted waters. This recession is driven by a drought in investment, not a conventional drought in consumption. High risk capital investment funding -- one of the driving forces behind the powerful expansion of the mid- and late-1990s -- has dried up. Venture capital funding is down more than 50% so far this year and the IPO market is moribund.
Over the past several weeks, the White House proclamations on the economy by Larry Lindsey and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill have been mostly happy talk about recovery by the end of the year. Let's hope they're right. But what if they're not? Where is the economic and political contingency plan? A pep talk is not enough to rescue the economy from its doldrums. True, many Wall Street economists are also predicting a resumption of growth soon, but they have been totally wrong in predicting the direction of the economy and stock market over the past several years, so their confidence is actually discouraging."

A variety of economists interviewed yesterday said a gradual decline in the nominal price of oil on balance would be good for the country. But most thought a sharp drop in petroleum prices could cause serious problems for a number of important sectors of the American economy, including the oil, banking, coal, natural gas and synthetic fuels industries.
â€œIn the long term, lower oil prices would mean greater economic growth for the American economy,â€ù said Eric Zausner, who heads the energy division of the consulting firm Booz-Allen & Hamilton. â€œBut in the short term, most of the effects would be negative.
â€œThe irony is that when oil ; soared to $34 per barrel, peo- ,* pie said how bad it was for ' the U.S. economy. And now that it may go back to $25, people are saying how bad it would be for the American â€¢ economy. Well in both cases, they were right, because any ' sudden change causes short-, term economic dislocations.â€ù- benefiting at least modestly from a continued fall in the price of gasoline and home heating oil, which would leave them with money to spend on other things.

Sawhill, a former federal energy administrator and now senior partner with the consulting firm of McKin-sey & Co. â€œI believe it would be very stimulative to the economy.â€ù"

Congress still could find some way to reduce the deficits. But, in the absence of major spending cuts and tax increases, interest rates are likely to stay so high that the important, housing and auto industries almost certainly will remain deeply depressed, according to a number of economists. The high rates also probably will lead businesses to keep cutting back their capital investment plans, the key to healthy, longterm economic growth.
Murray L. Weidenbaum, Reaganâ€™s chief economist, recently said that even the $56 billion worth of spending cuts and revenue-raising measures proposed in the presidentâ€™s February budget are not regarded as large enough to relieve pressures in financial markets and bring interest rates down. There will be â€œa slower, less robust recoveryâ€ù if there is no budget accord, he said. .
POLICY, From A1 mann, an economist at Morgan Stanley & Co., a New York investment banking firm, said last week that in the absence of â€œa significant change in the budgetary trend currently in prospect... we expect that any drops in interest rates will be shortlived, which should serve effectively to limit the scope of economic expansion this year and next.â€ù
One of the few points on which the administration and congressional negotiators agreed was that, without tax increases or further spending cuts, the 1983 deficit likely would be about $180 billion, and that figure assumed that the economy would begin growing at about a 4 percent annual 'rate at mid-year. A weaker economy could push this figure higher."

Federal-funds futures, which price off Fed policy expectations, imply the target rate will be 0.5% by August 2015 versus near-zero today.
But there still is a great deal of uncertainty on when ""liftoff,"" as Fed policy makers call it, will occur. That is largely because the unemployment rate doesn't seem to be fully capturing how much slack remains in the job market.

Economist Robert Hall has been puzzling over a thorny question for nearly a year: What do you call an economy that has started expanding again but keeps destroying jobs?
Mr. Hall heads a committee at the National Bureau of Economic Research, an academic group in Cambridge, Mass., that declares when U.S. recessions begin and end. In May of last year, Mr. Hall and his colleagues believed the latest recession might be over. Consumers were spending more and economic output was rising. All that the committee members needed to see was a few months of uninterrupted job growth to announce the end of the recession. ""It seemed like the timing was imminent,"" he says.
But Mr. Hall is still waiting. Instead of expanding employment, companies are continuing to shed jobs at a furious pace -- 525,000 nonfarm payroll positions in the past three months alone. Since March 2001, when the recession began, the U.S. economy has lost 2.1 million jobs. The total number of people unemployed -- including discouraged workers who would prefer to work but have stopped looking -- is about 9.2 million. And the number of people who are working part time because they can't find full-time work is 4.8 million, up 46% since 2001, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
In short, the U.S. is experiencing the most protracted job-market downturn since the Great Depression. It has left behind a remarkably broad swath of workers -- from young to old, and from high-school dropouts to the highly educated -- even as the economy has started growing again."

And, to round out the picture, the Wall Street Journal reported this week that lending at the 19 largest TARP recipients was 23 percent lower in February -- by which time these banks had received hundreds of billions of dollars in public funds intended to enable them to lend more -- than it had been in October, before the floodgates of tax dollars had been fully opened.
The week began with a burst of creative accounting. Citigroup, into which we've sunk more dough than any other company, with the possible exception of AIG, claimed a profit for the first quarter of this year because its bonded debt has lost value, which under the rules of accountancy enabled it to register a one-time gain equal to that lost value, because Citi could, in theory, buy back its own bonds for less. J.P. Morgan Chase, whose fire-sale purchase of Bear Stearns we taxpayers backed, declared a similar profit because of a similar decline in the value of its bonds.
As events would have it, the very same Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase are the lead negotiators for the banks that are objecting to the Obama administration's efforts to restructure Chrysler. Chrysler's bonds, which these banks hold, are trading at 15 cents on the dollar, the amount the government offered to pay the banks in its initial proposal to restore the company to viability. Yesterday, the government upped that amount to 22 cents, plus a 5 percent equity share in the company. Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase, however, insist that they and their fellow banks are entitled to more, though that ""more"" could only come at the expense of Fiat (the auto company that is providing the new car lines and technology without which Chrysler will fold) or the company's retirees (to whose health-care fund Chrysler is legally obligated) who built the company, or the taxpayers who are keeping Chrysler alive.
Instead of playing Scrooge (and a publicly subsidized Scrooge, at that), what the banks should do is lend Chrysler their accountants. Maybe they'd show that the company turned a profit last year.
The banks' lobbyists, meanwhile, have been hard at work, too. Bills to limit credit card fees and penalties -- my favorite fee is the one banks charge some customers for making (not missing, making) a payment -- are moving through both houses of Congress, but the Senate version has yet to receive any support from Republicans. A bill that would enable bankruptcy judges to modify mortgage terms has also hit a wall in the Senate, with Republican leaders claiming the backing of all 41 of their members to filibuster the bill when it comes to the floor."

There are always tradeoffs and harm from price controls, and quantitative easing has been the most ambitious and far-reaching price-control policy ever attempted. QE's massive bond purchases and money creation eroded market confidence and sidelined capital for many who attributed a phony recovery and an artificial economy to QE. Mohammed El Erian, the CEO of Pimco, the world's largest bond fund manager, points out that Fed creation of money in $4 trillion of QE bond purchases added a mere quarter of 1% (0.25%) to GDP growth -- a lousy tradeoff considering the heightened risks of inflation from QE money expansion and the risks of Fed insolvency from the attendant precipitous fall in bond prices.
In spite of the rise in asset prices of stocks and real estate from QE policies, it may turn out that far less new wealth was actually created if those prices deflate when QE liquidity is withdrawn.
QE has been accompanied by the worst post-recession recovery on record since the Great Depression in terms of GDP growth and a 40-year low in the labor-force participation rate. By maintaining interest rates at abnormally low levels, QE masks the real cost of the growing entitlement state while it also helped bailout and re-elect President Obama, resulting in a continuation of failed fiscal policies and the postponement of the day of reckoning on national debt and entitlement reform, which are essential for sustainable economic recovery.

Citicorp, the nationâ€™s largest bank company, filed the application for the Towson bank last year under a Maryland law that permits out-of-state banks to set up facilities that are restricted from competing with Maryland banks.

The proposed Chase facility in Virginia was one of nine applications New Yorkâ€™s second-biggest bank company filed with the comptroller of the currency to set up banking facilities. Earlier, Chase had filed applications for 16 other nonbank banks.
The nonbank banks are designed to get around federal laws that prohibit banks from setting up operations in other states. To be a bank under that law, an institution must offer checking accounts and make commercial loans. While most banks are trying to set up consumer institutions that make no commercial loans, Chase wants to establish facilities that make business loans but do not accept checking accounts.

842616877,u.s.-industrial-output-jumped-0.9%-in-april-despite-higher-interest-rates,wsj_398730422,2000-05-16,"WASHINGTON -- Production by U.S. factories, mines and utilities continued to accelerate in April, offering further evidence of the economy's strength in the face of rising interest rates.
Industrial output jumped 0.9% last month from March, its fastest pace in almost two years, the Federal Reserve said. Output is now 6.1% higher than it was a year earlier. The March gain, meanwhile, was revised upward to 0.7%, sharply higher than the preliminary estimate of a 0.3% increase. Taken together, the numbers suggest that U.S. industrial production continues to gain strength and that the April increase isn't a one-month anomaly.
With suppliers straining to keep up with strong consumer and business demand, the nation's capacity-utilization rate jumped 0.4% to 82.1%, the first time that the index has climbed above 82% in about two years. Utilization rates of less than 84%, however, suggest that manufacturers have enough slack to increase output without triggering production delays or bottlenecks
The report came as the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee prepared to meet here to consider a further interest-rate increase designed to slow the pace of the economy's growth while keeping inflation under wraps. The central bank has raised rates by a quarter of a percentage point five times since last June, but is widely expected to choose a more aggressive, half-point increase at its meeting today. A half-point move would bring the federal-funds rate -- the rate at which banks lend to each other overnight -- to its highest level in about nine years.
Still, yesterday's report offers some good news on the inflation front. Most of the overall increase in industrial output came about because of a 1.6% run-up in production of computers and other information-processing hardware and software. This and other technology have helped spark the massive productivity gains, which have held inflation in check in recent years. Technology production rose 2.7% in April, and is up an eye-popping 59% year over year. Consumer goods production, by comparison, increased 0.6% after being flat the last two months."

New-home sales increased 8.3% last month to a seasonally adjusted rate of 497,000, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That was the highest level since May 2008. Sales were up 38% from a year earlier.
The sales jump comes amid a sharp escalation in mortgage rates, which began rising in late May. The average for a 30-year fixed-rate loan is now up about one percentage point from its recent low to 4.58%, according to Mortgage Bankers Association data also released Wednesday. That's down from 4.68% a week earlier.
""The increase in mortgage rates over the past two months does not appear to have dented new-home sales, at least not yet,"" said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group. He cited pent-up demand, a better labor market and stronger consumer confidence as factors behind the sales boost.
Mortgage rates can hit new-home sales more quickly than sales of previously owned homes because the new-home figures are measured when a buyer signs a contract to purchase a new home. Existing-home sales figures reflect closings 30 to 60 days later, on average, after a contract is signed."

Gramley predicted yesterday that concern about the pace of economic growth in the United States and elsewhere will cause the Fed to continue to ease monetary policy.
Gramley, now chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association, said that, if the Japan and West German central banks would agree to a coordinated set of interest-rate cuts, the Fed probably would reduce its 51/2 percent discount rate within four to six weeks. If the other nations do not agree, such a reduction probably still would come within two to three months, he said.
As recently as two weeks ago, many financial-market participants seemed to share Gramleyâ€™s view that the Fed would continue to reduce the discount rate, which is the interest rate it charges on loans to financial institutions. Since then, scattered signs of faster economic growth and new fears about inflation have turned market sentiment around; long-term interest rates, in particular, have been rising.
Prior to a rally yesterday, some long-term government bonds had dropped more than six points, with each point representing $10 in market value. Bond prices decline when investors demand higher yields before buying them.

Despite cold, snowy weather that walloped major swaths of the country in January, and uneven sales throughout the sector in December, the early consensus is that retailers for the most part posted solid earnings growth for the quarter. That's due in part to a robust November that lured shoppers with discounts galore as well as the retailers' ability to keep inventories and expenses in line after having tough lessons learned during the recession.
That's the good news. With mounting prices on everything from fuel and food to cotton, retailers still are expected to offer muted full-year earnings guidance for 2011. Broad inflation hasn't beset clothing makers and sellers in almost two decades and rising costs will pose a quandary for stores: Do they pass those higher costs onto still-strapped consumers, who may in turn buy less? Or do they absorb some of the cost and take a hit to their gross profit margins?
The first half of the year poses additional challenges, particularly for department stores and discounter Target Corp. They will be lapping their toughest sales comparisons from a year ago.

842614587,behind-the-middle-class-funk,wsj_1418097249,2013-08-07,"President Obama is working hard to refocus attention on the middle class, and rightly so. While a decent society will provide opportunity and, when necessary, direct assistance to the poor, the long-term health of our economy and our democracy depends on a prosperous, self-confident middle class.
That's not what we've had in recent years. Median incomes fell sharply during the Great Recession and have barely begun to recover. Despite recent signs of recovery, housing -- the principal source of wealth for middle-class households -- remains priced about 25% below its pre-recession peak. Many workers who lost middle-income jobs have found only part-time or low-wage replacements and doubt that they will ever regain their pre-recession standard of living. Not surprisingly, many middle-class parents now doubt that their children will enjoy comparable lives
Concern about the middle class is not new. Compared with the quarter-century after World War II, recent decades -- though not disastrous -- were disappointing, even before the Great Recession. Many economists define the middle class as those adults whose annual household income is between two-thirds and twice the national median -- today, that means roughly $40,000 to $120,000. By this standard, according to the Pew Research Center, the middle class is significantly smaller than it once was. In 1971, it accounted for fully 61% of adults, compared with 14% for the upper class and 25% for the lower class.
Four decades later, the middle class share had declined by 10 percentage points to just 51%, while the upper class share increased by six points and the lower class by four. The U.S. income distribution is still a bell curve, but the left and right tails are fatter and the hump in the middle is lower.
This means that the middle class is less economically and socially dominant than it once was. Relatively speaking, more Americans are enjoying affluent lives at the same time that more are just barely making it (if at all). But that doesn't mean the middle class got poorer. During those 40 years, Pew calculates, the median income of middle-class households (adjusted for inflation) grew by 34%. The median grew for the others as well -- by 43% for upper-income households and 29% for those with incomes below the middle class. This isn't surprising, because the median income for all U.S. households rose by 32% during that period, from $44,845 in 1970 to $59,127 in 2010. Indeed, 86% of middle-class Americans, and 84% of all Americans, enjoy higher incomes than their parents did."

From the gift of government-subsidized electricity to his Hill Country neighbors at the start of his career, to Medicare and Model Cities in the high-flying Great Society days at the end, he practiced generosity of unparalleled scale with the taxpayers' money. His stump speeches in the 1964 campaign promised that Washington would provide help for ""Molly and the babies,"" down to and specifically including ""a house for the family and pictures on the walls.""
Appreciative as they were of those benefits, the voters have decided in every presidential election but one since 1968 that enough is enough. Though they regularly tell pollsters they think the Democrats are more sympathetic to working people and their problems and have given those Democrats a near-permanent lease on Congress, they have thought it prudent to keep a check on extravagance by having the GOP control the White House.
This is a gut-level, instinctive, extraconstitutional addition to the many other ""checks and balances"" in our system of government.

The theory is that lower prospective deficits will reduce pressure on the financial markets, reduce fear of future inflation, and for both reasons bring a reduction in interest rates that will let the economy off the floor of recession.
All sides agree that high interest rates are a leading cause of the economyâ€™s problems. But there is lively disagreement about the rest of the equation: just what is keeping rates high now, and how best to bring them down without harming the economy in other ways.
President Reagan has himself been afflicted by this split in opinion. Thus he has said that the likely deficits over the next several years are keeping rates high, in part because they are raising inflationary expectations and leaving investors unwilling to lend except at extremely high rates. But he has also taken a contrary view and, citing cases in the Midwest where local banks have cut their rates, has argued that interest rates should come down because the inflation rate has come down so rquch in recent months.

The deficit accord still faces hurdles in Congress and hardly stirred enthusiasm in financial markets. The tasks of the central bank, instead of being reduced, may actually have been increased.
If the budget pact appears likely to restrain economic growth, the Fed must decide whether to offset it and, if so, how vigorously. An expansionary policy, designed to hold down interest rates, could further weaken the dollar, a prospect that worries at least some Federal Reserve officials. A deeper fall for the dollar could heighten inflation fears -- fears that still are held by some Fed officials.
Most economists so far give Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan high marks for the central bank's actions since the stock-market crash on October 19. But some worries are creeping in. The Fed, as promised, flooded the banks with liquidity immediately after the crash, but the period of extreme ease ended quickly. After the first couple of weeks the central bank seemed to seek a more even keel, occasionally pulling reserves out of the banks.
The situation is confusing the analysts. Those who focus on the money supply, such as Edward S. Hyman of the investment firm of C.J. Lawrence Inc., worry about a decline in M1, the narrowly defined money supply. ""Now that the market has settled down,"" he says, ""money may be stabilizing. Alternatively, these declines may indicate that the economy has weakened.""

But last week the department released revised figures indicating those cheers were for nought. Instead of growing at an inflation-adjusted 4.3% rate, as previously thought, the new figures showed economic growth was limping in the fourth quarter of 1984 at a meager 0.6% pace.
That drastic change illustrates how the highly technical ""benchmark"" statistical revisions completed recently by the department have revamped the economic landscape. The department is the sole source of statistics on the nation's total output, or gross national product, and when it alters its numbers, it alters everyone else's view of the world.
The department's revisions altered virtually all the GNP figures back to 1972, and in some cases reached as far back as 1929.

Government reports released yesterday showed that prices for finished goods and the output of the nation's factories continued to fall last month, providing further solid evidence that the U.S. recession was worsening during February.
In the financial markets, however, attention remained focused on other signs that the economic slump may be coming to an end. As a result, long-term interest rates rose and the value of the surging U.S. dollar strengthened further yesterday.
Among those signs was an unusual interim report by researchers at the University of Michigan who survey U.S. consumer attitudes each month. While declining to release the exact figures, a survey official said the initial sampling of consumer sentiment this month showed such a sharp improvement that a special report was issued to the survey's clients.
Many economists believe that plunging consumer sentiment, depressed by soaring energy prices and uncertainty over the Persian Gulf War, caused a large drop in buying that, in turn, was a major factor in the current recession."

The trade gap widened 3.6% to a record $48.3 billion in April, from March's $46.6 billion, according to the Commerce Department. The deficit reflected a decline in exports of $1.5 billion, while imports remained largely flat. The drop covered a broad range of exports, but a number of analysts dismissed it as a statistical aberration.
""Over the last year, exports were up 10%; over the last three months, exports rose almost 20% at an annual rate,"" says John Ryding, chief U.S. economist for the investment bank Bear Stearns. ""The trend is unambiguously higher."" The National Association of Manufacturers also dismissed the decline as ""a one-time correction.""
The widening trade deficit could put downward pressure on the dollar as investors lose confidence in the ability of the U.S. to repay its debts, boosting the prices of imports higher than they otherwise would be. But the deficit can also be a signal of economic strength. That is because the U.S. is growing more rapidly than other industrialized nations and absorbing more imports than its trading partners.
Retail sales, which grew at a 1.2% pace in May, compared with a 0.6% drop in April, was another signal of a strengthening U.S. economy. May's growth drew on a healthier job market and aggressive discounting at car dealerships looking to counter higher gasoline prices. Light- vehicle sales among the Big Three U.S. auto makers rose 14.6% in May compared with the month before, the National Automobile Dealers Association said."

The claim was that failing to raise taxes on high-income earners would place a disproportionate share of the pain on the rest. But it is our record-high government spending, not the failure to raise taxes on the rich, that is the typical American's largest long-term problem.
Workers do well only when the economy grows at a healthy and consistent pace. The biggest threat to long-term economic growth is government growth of the magnitude that characterized the past two years and that is forecast for our future.
Our current problems are not a result of acts of nature. They stem from policy choices that dramatically increased the size of the government. In the past two years, the federal budget has grown by a whopping 16%. Importantly, growth in agency budgets other than Defense exceeded that in Defense, despite the surge in Afghanistan. The budget for Health and Human Services, for example, home to Medicare and Medicaid, rose a hefty 22%, as compared with 12% for Defense.
The sum of 11 other agencies, such as the Departments of Agriculture, Education and Labor, which combined account for more annual spending than Defense, experienced an increase of more than 50% over the two-year period. Some of the budget increases, like those associated with unemployment insurance, should disappear when the economy rebounds, but much of the addition is permanent and is reflected in the president's projected future budget numbers.
What has the increase bought us? The president would have us believe that but for the stimulus, the economy would have sunk into the next Great Depression. The numbers tell a different story. Estimates of the effect of the stimulus on gross domestic product (GDP) range from zero to three percentage points of GDP. The current recession set GDP back by nine percentage points relative to where it would have been had times been normal."

Some financial market analysts had expressed concern during the past few weeks that the sharp dip in the value of the dollar against the Japanese yen would make U.S. Treasury securities less attractive to Japanese investors, requiring the Treasury to bid up interest rates on those issues to lure foreigners back.
A weaker dollar means that foreigners earn less on their investments when their profits are converted into their own currencies. The government needs foreign participation in its securities to finance the deficit.
The government said in a special budget supplement issued yesterday that the proportion of federal debt held by foreigners has actually declined compared to the late 1970s and early 1980s.

Their big fear: that today's strength will tempt the Federal Reserve Board into slamming on the brakes too hard.
As executives prepared for the winter meeting of the National Association of Manufacturers, which began here yesterday, interviews with a number of those attending the meeting reveal widespread nervousness about a possible economic slowdown beginning in the middle of this year -- but few concrete signs of it arriving yet. Indeed, conditions are so strong that some executives say they are able to raise prices on their products for the first time in several years, a possible harbinger of higher inflation.
""We see very strong growth,"" says Donald Rainville, president of Universal Dynamics Inc., a small company in Woodbridge, Va., that manufactures machinery used in making plastics. Varian Associates Inc., a Palo Alto, Calif., maker of healthcare systems, semiconductor equipment and electron devices, ended last year with record orders. At Tenneco Inc., which had fourth-quarter and full-year earnings gains of more than 50%, orders for farm machinery, construction equipment and auto parts continue to be strong, while the company has advance orders for all the containers and container board it can make.
""Our business conditions are excellent,"" says Dana Mead, chairman and chief executive of Tenneco, and vice chairman of the association's board. But the association, which represents 12,000 manufacturers, doesn't expect conditions to remain that way.
Gordon Richards, the association's chief economist, expects gross domestic product to grow under 3% this year, compared with 4% in 1994. With interest rates sharply higher than last year at this time, many members see a slowdown as inevitable -- beginning with the interest-rate sensitive industries like automotive and housing. Fixed-rate mortgages, for example, have risen more than two percentage points in the past year and now stand at about 9.10%, a level that is beginning to discourage buyers."

In the final three sessions of 1986, prices of some long-term Treasury bonds slumped nearly two points, or almost $20 for each $1,000 face amount. The setback came amid concern about a recent surge in oil prices and the dollar's continued slump in foreign-exchange markets. These developments, along with a sharp increase in the price of gold Wednesday, have intensified fears among some investors about the inflation outlook.
Most forecasters in recent surveys still expect higher bond prices in coming months because they say the Federal Reserve System probably will drive down interest rates in an effort to rejuvenate the economy. But some are having second thoughts, especially as several recent government reports have indicated the economy may be perking up somewhat.

At about $110 billion a month, that is not that far off the huge monthly net issuance Uncle Sam is churning out to fund the deficit.
Strangely, the Fed's bold decision follows a period in which U.S. economic data have shown some improvement. Manufacturing activity rebounded in October, retail sales have shown surprising strength and even private-sector hiring is gradually picking up steam. Plus, there are clear risks that the Fed's action will create economic and market distortions.
Yet those received little acknowledgment in the Fed's statement. The central bank's justification for the move is that unemployment, at 9.7%, remains too high, that core inflation is too low, and that lackluster gross domestic product growth is unlikely to change that soon.
Also, having encouraged markets to factor in another bout of monetary experimentation, the Fed probably did not feel it had the option to disappoint.

Prices of some actively traded 30-year Treasury bonds fell almost 1 1/4 points, or nearly $12.50 for each $1,000 face amount, after falling about 1 1/2 points Friday. The two-day loss erased all the gains made last Thursday when Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker confirmed that the Fed was pushing up short-term interest rates to help stabilize the dollar.
Traders said the bond market was rife with rumors about how active Japanese investors would be in the government's quarterly refunding operation, which begins today. As the dollar continued to fall against the yen yesterday, some analysts speculated about whether Japanese investors would participate in the refunding auctions at all.
""There's no reason for anyone, American or Japanese, to buy bonds right now,"" said Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Co. ""Economic activity is picking up, the inflation rate is rising, and there's no clear evidence that the U.S. is prepared to defend the dollar at its current level. For a foreign investor, there's a currency risk as well as an inflation risk in buying bonds.""
But another analyst, who requested anonymity, said he believes Japanese will be buyers in the refunding. ""It makes a lot of sense for them to be in it, and it also makes sense for them to pooh-pooh it beforehand,"" he said. ""It's to their advantage to do the most surprising thing. So if the market has been beat up, and everyone's pessimistic, then they collectively have enough size to buy a lot of bonds, cause a short-covering rally and make some nice profits."""

The blue-chip index rode a roller coaster throughout the day, rising over the 1,500 level in opening trading before retreating. It then staged a series of narrow advances and declines straddling the 1,500 mark and rising as high as 1,514 before ending only slightly higher at the close.
As on Monday, the market was spurred by expectations of lower inflation stemming from dropping oil prices and by the bond market rally, which pushed interest rates lower in response to progress by
Monte Gordon, a vice president and director of research for Dreyfus Corp., said 1,500 on the Dow remained a psychological barrier because the stock market had â€œused a lot of money to get thereâ€ù and many investors might view the strength of the recent rally with trepidation."

The Dow Jones industrial average falls 103 points from April 20 to 24 -- only the second weekly decline since Jan. 9. Then, on Monday, after news that the Federal Reserve Board might raise interest rates, the Dow drops 147 points.
Looks like trouble, and the newspapers are full of stories about analysts predicting a slide. But later in the week, the Dow bounces back by more than 200 points after reports that economic growth is strong and inflation nowhere in sight -- except perhaps in the stock market itself.
All the blather about the stock market being too high (or too low), about bulls and bears, about the latest GDP and CPI -- it's extraneous noise. Certainly, you should be alert to specific opportunities in individual stocks, and the economy and inflation sometimes influence the chances of, say, auto stocks or bank stocks that might be depressed.
But what investors need to remember about the market as a whole are the simple things: In the short run stocks are wildly volatile, but in the long run they are no more risky than Treasury bonds and money market funds. If you need your money in the next seven years, you have no business putting a significant portion of your wealth in the stock market. If you can keep your money working for the long term, it makes sense to be in with both feet -- as long as you can sleep at night."

That's the view of many investors who have braced for a Democratic presidency by driving up the long-term Treasury bond yield more than one-half percentage point in two months to 7.76%, the highest since midyear.
Looking ahead, economists and money managers expect bond yields to remain flat to higher until after President-elect Bill Clinton announces his economic program. They don't expect any big surge in yields unless Mr. Clinton does something rash -- such as announce a deficit-widening blitz of short-term government spending. They say the economy is so weak that inflation isn't likely to come roaring back soon.
""We think that rates could go down or up, but not much in either direction,"" says Ian A. MacKinnon, senior vice president and head of fixed income at Vanguard Group Inc., a mutual fund company. ""Clinton is somewhat of a hostage to the federal deficit, which is going to significantly constrict his ability to launch huge spending programs.""
Still, the long-term outlook for bonds isn't enticing to many investors. ""We're in the twilight of the bull market,"" says Richard J. Hoffman, chief investment strategist at Cowen & Co., which manages some $1 billion.

A host of factors were at work, analysts and traders said, from logistical delays in the pipeline and refinery system that would damp demand for crude, to a lack of global supply problems despite violence in Iraq, Libya and Eastern Europe. Taken together, the factors resulted in traders cutting back on bets that prices would rise from the record levels reached in recent months.
""As time has gone by, speculators have decided they don't want to wait much longer for an actual impact on oil supply,"" said Mark Vonderheide, managing partner of trading firm Geneva Energy Markets.
Last week, a fire caused CVR Refining LP to shut down its 115,000-barrel-a-day refinery in Coffeyville, Kan., for repairs, the latest problem for U.S. crude.

Hiring in the health and hospitality industries and a spike in government employment made up for a drop in construction jobs and a continued decline in manufacturing employment.

All the talk about Japan or Germany being the new No. 1 has faded quickly -- at least for now. So has the idea that military power became irrelevant with the collapse of communism. These thoughts seem naive at a time when a military force has risen in the Persian Gulf that threatens the wealth on which Japanese and German clout has been built.
Only the U.S. has the means to move mass military force around the globe in days and to rally numerous other nations to the cause. And, for all its economic woes, the U.S. can back up that military might with an economy far larger than any rival's.
""This crisis in the Gulf is the answer to the argument that we've reached the end of history, that peace has broken out, that military power doesn't matter and the only coin of influence in the world is economic power,"" Harold Brown, a former defense secretary, said. These popular claims are being shown up as exaggerations.
But no matter how good the crisis has made Americans feel so far, with President Bush rallying support by making frank allusions to stopping a new Hitler, it obscures the shift in the world power game. Military might still counts, but there is a new emphasis on economic strength, and the U.S. isn't well prepared to retain that aspect of global leadership."

Whether that cloud produces a nourishing rain shower -- in the form of swelling U.S. exports and a recovery of manufacturing jobs - - or a deluge of rising interest rates and soaring budget deficits is the subject of increasingly heated economic debate.
Recent news of rapid third-quarter economic growth, rising consumer spending and climbing personal incomes did little to budge the dollar from its record lows against the 12-nation euro. The dollar has fallen about one-third against the unified European currency over the past three years -- 15 percent this year alone. In the past 23 months, the dollar has slid 11 percent against all the world's currencies, according to Stephen S. Roach, chief global economist at Morgan Stanley & Co.
For now, economists say, the decline has on balance been a boon to the U.S. economy, pushing the price of American-made goods and services lower on the international market, stimulating exports while trimming imports. Indeed, the economic forecasting firm Global Insight Inc. has calculated that the dollar's decline has saved as many as 700,000 manufacturing jobs since the slide began in earnest two years ago. And as long as inflation stays low, there will be little pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise short-term rates from their historic lows.
But concerns are growing, especially on Wall Street, that the dollar's slide will inevitably drive up long-term interest rates, and some analysts think the decline could even force the Fed to raise the rates it targets. That could slow the nascent economic recovery, swell the already-record federal budget deficit and possibly resurrect an economic problem unseen for nearly 20 years: inflation."

The Institute for Supply Management said its overall index of manufacturing activity, based on the survey, rose to 49.4 in May from 45.4 in April. While it was the third month below 50, which marks the dividing line between an expanding and contracting industrial economy, components of the index were more upbeat.
For example, the subindexes for new orders and production rose above 50 for the first time in three months, and the subindex for the backlog of orders topped 50 for the first time in 11 months. However, employment contracted again, for the 32nd month in a row, the survey found.

""This is not really unusual when the economy is at a crossroads.""
The index hardly suggests the robust activity of a normal recovery. After expanding most of last year, manufacturing had sunk into a recession in recent months. While Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan blamed jitters and high energy prices caused by the conflict with Iraq, others blamed the continuing adjustment of consumers and corporations to the decline in asset values and excess capacity, a legacy of the burst stock bubble of the 1990s."

Federal and private-loan lending totaled $106 billion for the 2013-14 academic year, down 8% from the prior year, according to a report to be released Thursday by the nonprofit College Board. The decline marks a significant reversal in borrowing, which peaked at $122.1 billion in 2010-11 after rising for years.
The drop is partly due to a decline in enrollment at for-profit colleges, where most students borrow and where default rates are generally higher. The schools have come under increased scrutiny since 2010, when a report by the Government Accountability Office found deceptive practices that ranged from promising unrealistically high pay for graduating students to not disclosing total tuition costs for students before they enrolled.
At traditional colleges, families have been cutting back on expenses, experts say. A growing share of students are commuting from home rather than living on campus, for example, according to a report issued earlier this year by SLM Corp., the largest private student lender, also known as Sallie Mae.
An improving economy and stock market are also likely contributing to families borrowing less, says Mark Kantrowitz, senior vice president at Edvisors.com, a Las Vegas-based firm that tracks financial aid and student loans.

And, at least in the near term, last year's balanced-budget law has greatly improved the outlook for Medicare, the federal health program for 38 million elderly and disabled people. It should stay solvent until 2008, seven years longer than the trustees projected last April, largely because the balanced-budget law lowers Medicare spending by $115 billion in the next five years.
The Social Security trust fund, which pays retirement and other benefits to 44 million Americans each month, had been expected to go broke in 2029 as Americans live longer and the baby boom retires. But the ""strength in the U.S. economy"" has almost single-handedly bought the system another three years, said Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, a trustee. The six trustees -- two private citizens and four government officials -- oversee the financial operations of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds and report on them to Congress each year. The trustees expect lower inflation and unemployment rates, higher productivity and inflation-adjusted wage gains and a smaller decline in average hours worked in the next 10 years than they had projected in last year's report. The rosier outlook reflects both the economy's recent superlative performance and expectations about the near future. With more Americans working, payroll taxes paid to support Social Security are expected to rise more than previously thought. And with lower price inflation, yearly cost-of-living raises to retirees will likely be smaller.
As a result, the size of Social Security's projected 75-year deficit declined slightly to 2.19% of taxable payroll from the 2.23% projected last year. And the balanced-budget agreement halved Medicare's projected 75-year deficit to about 2% of taxable payroll.
The trustees' updated projections still are more conservative than the most optimistic observers: They expect the U.S. economy to grow about 2% a year on average in the next decade, about fourtenths of a percentage point slower than in the past decade."

From 1988 to 1992 the nation experienced double-digit and near-double-digit increases in health spending each year. The rate eased to 7 percent in 1993 and the growth rate now has fallen again to 6.4 percent.

Authors Katharine Levit, Helen Lazenby and Lekha Sivarajan said the slow rate of increase appears to stem from employers switching coverage for their workers from conventional fee-for-service plans to health maintenance organizations and other managed-care plans that often charge less. Low inflation also is a contributing factor.

Its invention and survival illustrate just how mediocre much political journalism is: simplistic, lacking in historical perspective and often wrong. The first job of journalism is to ""get it right"" - to be accurate. All too often, political reporting doesn't. It amounts to mythmaking.
I take as my text for this grumpy thesis two recent articles in powerful publications. Both try to explain President Clinton's troubles and successes in terms of the alleged Reagan Revolution. Both exemplify persisting sins of political journalism, which is often a triumph of slogans over facts. Politics is viewed, as James Reston often wrote, as sport. The object of reporting is to explain who wins, who loses, why and what it means.
The trouble is that politics is not just a game - a series of electoral and legislative contests - but also an expression of national habits and values. Unless these are understood, politics can't be adequately reported. Much political commentary ignores this larger context. Consider a front-page ""news analysis"" in the New York Times on Aug. 1. Titled ""Reagan's Curse on Clinton,"" it attributed Clinton's difficulty in passing his budget to ""the Presidency of Ronald Reagan and the political climate he created.""
Wrote R. W. Apple Jr., the Times' Washington bureau chief: ""Mr. Reagan successfully argued that government itself was the problem. Most federal programs were bad; taxes were bad; spending was bad... . {The result is that} politicians are terrified to wear that awful label, `tax and spend,' however much their constituents need government money for health care or roads.""
Every trend or change must be credited to or blamed on somebody. What's missed are deeper currents in American thinking and society. Reagan didn't create the mood that Apple describes. Americans have always been suspicious of concentrated power, and national government is - for better or worse - now our most powerful institution. Even in 1958, 43 percent of Americans felt that the federal government ""wasted a lot"" of money."

The Obama administration's budget projections claim that raising taxes on the top 2% of taxpayers, those individuals earning more than $200,000 and couples earning $250,000 or more, will increase revenues to the U.S. Treasury. The empirical evidence suggests otherwise. None of the personal income tax or capital gains tax increases enacted in the post-World War II period has raised the projected tax revenues.
Over the past six decades, tax revenues as a percentage of GDP have averaged just under 19% regardless of the top marginal personal income tax rate. The top marginal rate has been as high as 92% (1952-53) and as low as 28% (1988-90). This observation was first reported in an op-ed I wrote for this newspaper in March 1993. A wit later dubbed this ""Hauser's Law.""
Over this period there have been more than 30 major changes in the tax code including personal income tax rates, corporate tax rates, capital gains taxes, dividend taxes, investment tax credits, depreciation schedules, Social Security taxes, and the number of tax brackets among others. Yet during this period, federal government tax collections as a share of GDP have moved within a narrow band of just under 19% of GDP.
Why? Higher taxes discourage the ""animal spirits"" of entrepreneurship. When tax rates are raised, taxpayers are encouraged to shift, hide and underreport income. Taxpayers divert their effort from pro-growth productive investments to seeking tax shelters, tax havens and tax exempt investments. This behavior tends to dampen economic growth and job creation. Lower taxes increase the incentives to work, produce, save and invest, thereby encouraging capital formation and jobs. Taxpayers have less incentive to shelter and shift income.
On average, GDP has grown at a faster pace in the several quarters after taxes are lowered than the several quarters before the tax reductions. In the six quarters prior to the May 2003 Bush tax cuts, GDP grew at an average annual quarterly rate of 1.8%. In the six quarters following the tax cuts, GDP grew at an average annual quarterly rate of 3.8%.

Officials also are preparing to debate whether to fine-tune the Fed's formal assessment of the labor market and the guidance it provides about the likely path of interest rates.

The Fed has been buying mortgage and long-term Treasury bonds since 2012 in an effort to hold down long-term interest rates and stimulate the economy. The Fed said after its September meeting it intended to end the program this month. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said last week the Fed should consider extending the program because U.S. inflation expectations appear to be drifting down, a possible sign of continuing economic headwinds.

That's the argument advanced by growing numbers of economists and market participants, as Americans continue to find jobs at a steady clip and the unemployment rate drops sharply. Weary of the bond-market gyrations touched off by each monthly employment report, they have embarked on a quest for new clues about inflation. Some are even putting their faith in anecdotal evidence instead of the sometimes confounding signals from the statistical data.
""The employment numbers are becoming increasingly less relevant as the numbers of people finding jobs has grown,"" argues Nancy Kimelman, chief economist at Technical Data in Boston. ""Frankly, there aren't that many people left to hire. . . . A gain of 300,000 in today's labor market is the equivalent of what would have been [a] massive gain of 700,000 jobs four years ago.""
The reason, Ms. Kimelman says, is that as the rate at which Americans find new jobs has leveled off at around 230,000 a month, the unemployment rate continues to fall and average hourly earnings continue to climb. Indeed, Friday's report showed that average hourly earnings rose six cents in August to $11.87, the highest level seen since December 1990, and the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1%. Those factors helped cap the Treasury market's ""relief"" rally, touched off when traders saw that the overall job growth was within expected bounds.

Initial jobless claims declined 22,000 to 404,000 last week from 426,000 the previous week, the Labor Department said. The four-week average, which smooths out weekly fluctuations, fell to a one-month low of 428,250.
The drop was more than Wall Street economists expected, but it supported the Fed's statement Wednesday that ""labor and product markets . . . are stabilizing."" The central bank on Wednesday cut its key interest rate to a 45-year low of 1% from 1.25% and suggested it will keep the rate low as long as necessary to ensure an economic recovery. The Fed's assertion that the labor market was stabilizing surprised some observers, but it may have been influenced by the latest jobless claims data.
During the past 2 1/2 years, the U.S. economy has lost more than three million private-sector jobs, and the unemployment rate has climbed to a nine-year high of 6.1%. The number of initial claims for unemployment benefits, moreover, has remained above 400,000 for 19 consecutive weeks. Economists regard any number above 400,000 as suggestive of a deteriorating jobs market.
But for the past three weeks, the volume of initial claims has declined consistently, and economic forecasters say they expect job losses to end soon. The total number of workers drawing unemployment benefits for more than a week rose 43,000 to 3,741,000, reversing half of the previous week's decline. The unemployment rate for workers with unemployment insurance climbed 0.1 percentage point to 3%."

The Minneapolis food supplier said some cereals will increase by a ""low single-digit"" percentage rate effective Nov. 15. Kraft Foods Inc. is also raising prices, according to people familiar with the matter, although its scope wasn't clear. A Kraft spokesman declined to comment.
Across corporate America, more companies are wrestling with when and how much to raise prices as raw materials costs climb. The increases pose new hurdles to profits as consumers continue to resist increases.
General Mills is not alone in wanting to pass along the costs. United Technologies Corp., which builds helicopters, jet engines, elevators and air conditioners, expects to try and balance commodity increases with higher prices on its own products. Finance chief Gregory Hayes said Wednesday that higher prices for copper, oil and other commodities represent a between $40 million and $50 million expense ""headwind"" next year.

Perhaps Alan Greenspan had stopped tightening just in time to engineer a ""soft landing,"" I speculated, but if this rosy scenario did not materialize he ""may be short of maneuvering room."" Oil prices were already signaling that a downturn could well be accompanied by a danger of inflation. So if George W. Bush actually won, ""his tax proposal may be on the table none too soon.""
This has pretty much worked as advertised, except that it's too bad George W. Bush didn't propose a stimulative tax cut.
Well of course, the tax proposal President Bush sent to Congress is the same one candidate Bush had on the table in October. And with its attention to across-the-board marginal rate reductions, it certainly was a stimulative one when compared with Al Gore's tax proposal, a hodgepodge of spending programs in drag. But the economic downturn has become much clearer. Perhaps the economy will yet rebound in the second half; leading indicators rose in January after three months of decline, and Friday's employment figures were encouraging. Still, with earnings declines and even layoffs spreading, stimulus soon would be only prudent.
The Fed stepped up to the plate by lowering its short-term interest rate target, but the president has made no similar adjustment in his tax proposal. In the current environment, its long phase-in can no longer be overlooked. Experience warns that tax cuts usually stimulate only when they become effective. A phase-in creates incentives to delay income, perhaps making a downturn worse."

Wholesale prices of finished energy goods such as gasoline rose 4% in April, pushing up average prices on all finished goods -- everything from turkeys to tractors -- a greater-than-expected 0.9%, the Labor Department reported. But the closely watched ""core"" index of producer prices, which excludes energy and food, rose only 0.1%, well below expectations.
""Given all the energy-price hikes coming through, that's still very subdued,"" said Nigel Gault, U.S. economist at consultancy Global Insight.
Economists and investors watch wholesale prices closely as a signal of what may happen with the consumer-price index, a broader measure of inflation on which the government will report today. The two don't correlate closely from month to month, but producer prices do give some indication of what is coming in consumer prices.
In recent weeks, various indicators have pointed toward gathering inflation pressures, raising concerns that the Federal Reserve will have to extend its 23-month string of interest-rate increases. Also, the economy appears to have been running a lot hotter in the first quarter than initially believed. The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported last month that real gross domestic product -- the value of the nation's output, adjusted for inflation -- grew at an annual rate of 4.8% in the January-March period.

Analysts say these developments increase the chances that the Federal Reserve System will keep its credit policy unchanged. Until recently, many investors had feared that vigorous economic activity and rapid money growth would prompt the Fed to tighten its credit hold and drive up interest rates.
The Commerce Department yesterday estimated that the economy is growing at only a 2.1% annual rate this quarter, down from a 4.3% clip in last year's fourth quarter. The department's preliminary, or ""flash,"" estimate was well below the rate of about 4% that many analysts had been expecting.
Prices of some Treasury bonds rose almost 3/4 of a point, or nearly $7.50 for each $1,000 face amount. Most short-term interest rates declined.

Brusca, a vice president and economist at Irving Trust Co.
Donald E. Maude, chief economist at Refco Partners, agreed that the figures ""take a little pressure off the Fed"" to tighten credit conditions. But he argued that all they do is ""buy the Fed more time."" He contended that the economy and money-supply growth will reaccelerate, forcing the central bank to adopt a tougher credit policy by late next month."

Utah saw a nearly 34% jump in food-stamp participation in December from the same month a year earlier, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Nevada had the second fastest growth rate at 25%, followed by Idaho at 24%.
For the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, those three states plus Wyoming ranked among the top 10 in food-stamp growth, with Idaho leading with a 42% jump from 2009, according to USDA figures.
It's a striking shift for the area, reflecting a post-boom fallout that has been compounded by the many new residents drawn to the region by a hot economy who lacked a support network when jobs disappeared.

""I believe recovery will occur around mid-2002 -- a few months later than the median forecast predicts,"" Anthony Santomero, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said in a speech. He was one of five Fed officials to speak so far this week. Their comments, while more upbeat than they have been for months, suggest they are less impressed with the run of positive economic reports, ranging from capital-goods orders to home sales, than private forecasters and investors.
Mr. Santomero, for example, said it may take longer than expected for companies to rebuild inventories, something optimistic analysts are counting on to generate higher production and an imminent recovery. He said consumer spending, though resilient so far, could retrench if big layoffs persist.
A Wall Street Journal poll of 54 forecasters found that two-thirds expect the economy to grow in the current quarter, and almost all expect growth in the next quarter.
But Fed officials see more risks. Richmond Fed President Alfred Broaddus said in a speech that while the consensus forecast is ""the most probable outcome . . . I think there's a good chance that the economy may be at least a little softer than the consensus over the next year or so."" He cited the risk that continued weak profits will hold back business investment. On Monday, Atlanta Fed President Jack Guynn said the economy would probably contract ""for another quarter or two.""

That wasn't exactly how the market reacted Friday. Treasury-bond yields affect other interest rates across the economy, including those of fixed-rate mortgages and many corporate loans and bonds. Higher rates put a pinch on consumers and companies alike, and that squeezes profits.

The fear is that higher yields mark the end of the easy-money era that has been the stock market's prime driver since 2002. Consumers will find it more expensive to buy a home or to take out a home-equity loan and buy a new car. Businesses will find new investment more costly.

After weeks of troubling reports that suggested the U.S. economy stalled at the end of the summer, the Labor Department said nonfarm business productivity grew at an impressive 4% seasonally adjusted annual rate in the third quarter. That was more than double the 1.7% rate of the previous quarter, and a good indication that the underlying potential of the economy remains strong.
In the 12 months through September, nonfarm productivity grew 5.3%, its fastest rate in 19 years. Economists have attributed the gains to increased efficiencies from computers and the Internet, as well as the fact that employees that remain after a wave of layoffs tend to be more skilled. Although labor costs are rising, output is rising more than enough to compensate.
Such strong productivity doesn't necessarily change the short-term economic outlook, which remains somewhat gloomy. But it does suggest that corporate profits will continue to improve and that inflation will remain in check -- both of which are important if the economy is to get back on track.
When a company boosts productivity, it can squeeze more output from its existing workers without drastically increasing costs. At the same time, it helps keep a lid on inflation, as companies grow without incurring new expenses that they would otherwise pass on to customers."

The Fed targets annual inflation of 2%, a pace it views as healthy for price stability and economic growth. But the central bank prefers a separate measure -- the Commerce Department's price index for personal consumption expenditures -- that has shown less-dramatic price increases and inflation still running below its target, at 1.6% in April.
Still, both measures suggest inflation picked up in the spring after two years of sluggishness."

""The current economic expansion seems to have exhibited staying power,"" despite the drag from January's severe weather, the brief government shutdown and the recent General Motors Corp. strike, he said.
He also said high consumer-debt levels and other factors still might be restraining spending. But ""the recent data seem to indicate that those restraining influences are not so strong as to seriously jeopardize the continued expansion of the economy,"" Mr. Greenspan said.

Last year, when crude was at similar levels, prices retreated and the economy stayed resilient. But this year, there are some significant differences, triggering concerns that prices could be headed higher and that the economy could be vulnerable.
One main distinction: This time around, the economy isn't looking quite as healthy amid concerns about the weakened housing market and mortgage defaults.
In addition, in 2006, oil inventories were higher because of market incentives to store oil, which meant energy buyers had a stockpile. By contrast, today, different market incentives have led to much lower oil inventories in key regions.
That's troublesome, because the lack of a stockpile cushion means that any supply crunch could lead buyers -- oil refiners and speculators alike -- to quickly bid up crude-oil prices beyond $80 a barrel, just as the economy appears vulnerable to recession."

A survey of economic conditions in the 12 Federal Reserve districts found signs that factories are facing shortages and sharp price boosts for various industrial materials and supplies. The Philadelphia Fed also uncovered evidence that factory wages are rising as a result of worker shortages.
And a separate Fed report said the nation's factories, mines and utilities operated at 82.9% of capacity in May, higher than at any time since March 1980. Economists say that the closer business gets to operating at full capacity, the greater the risks of a spurt in inflation.
Separately, the Commerce Department said business inventories grew 0.5% in April, largely reflecting a jump in wholesalers' inventories. Sales by manufacturers, retailers and wholesalers dropped 0.2%. As a result, the ratio of inventories-to-sales increased slightly to 1.51 in April from 1.50 in March, remaining within the range in which the ratio has traveled for the past year.

While details are still being discussed, the program would most likely be voluntary and aimed at encouraging healthy institutions to participate. Under one scenario, banks could come to Treasury and ask for an injection rather than having Treasury determine which banks would get an infusion. Treasury is also discussing a plan in which the government would inject capital into firms that raise a certain amount of money on their own from the private sector.
Any program would include incentives for firms to participate, such as the government paying favorable prices for any equity stake. The government would most likely be a passive investor.

After a two-day meeting that ended Wednesday, the Fed's policy-making committee voted to leave short-term interest rates unchanged.

""There just wasn't enough evidence yet,"" said Chris Varvares, an economist with Macroeconomic Advisers, a St. Louis forecasting firm. ""Core prices are still decelerating, and there are clear signs that the burst of strength in the second quarter will slow to a more sustainable level during the second half.""

Also due soon are consumer and wholesale prices, retail sales, wages and the first estimate of total second-quarter growth. Many economists expect that number to exceed a 4% annual rate, compared with 2.2% in the first quarter -- well above the level thought to be sustainable without higher inflation, given today's tight labor markets.
In their deliberations, Fed policy makers had to look ahead into next year and would have tightened rates if they saw a clear threat of unsustainable growth leading to rising inflation. One factor that may have helped forestall a rate increase was the rising value of the dollar compared with the yen and mark, a rise that will brake the economy by cooling the booming export sector."

The big increase suggests consumer spending continues to be strong in spite of signs of weakness among the nation's manufacturing industries. Manufacturing employment declined last month, and many analysts believe that February industrial-production figures, to be reported tomorrow, will also show a decline.
This combination of strong demand and weak production suggests to many analysts that foreign manufacturers are taking a rapidly growing share of the U.S. market as this country's trade deficit widens.
""Thanks to the strong dollar, imports are clearly gaining market share,"" said Edward Yardeni, chief economist for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. A strong dollar makes imports less expensive and makes U.S. exports less competitive on world markets.

SLOWLY BUT surely, we seem to be abandoning the long-held notion that when it comes to business and the environment, you can't have it both ways. Our old zero-sum assumptions - profits and productivity versus the birds and the trees - have given way to a new understanding of the relationships between economics and ecology. ""Doing well"" is increasingly being associated with ""doing good"" for the earth. Conservation is no longer being seen as an inhibitor to growth, but as a stimulus for efficiency. Environmental responsibility is no longer some corporate feel-good issue, but an obligation - to customers, investors, employees, communities and others. To that extent, the notion of ""greener"" companies can be a win-win proposition, with salutary effects for both business and the earth.
That's an underlying message from Frances Cairncross, who argues in Costing the Earth that the partnership of clear-sighted economic policies and resourceful companies can survive, even thrive, in the new era of global environmental concern.
As environmental editor for the British magazine the Economist, Cairncross has a perspective rooted firmly on the east side of the Atlantic Ocean, where ""government regulation"" hasn't yet earned the same public scorn as ""acid rain."" Her desire to see taxes and regulations realign market signals so as to favor cleaner, greener products and processes is a laudable goal, to be sure, but it may be more at home in the current political climate of Munich, than in Marietta, Ga. Her belief that consumers and producers should pay the true costs of the environmental damage they cause is another worthy ideal, but of dubious practicality in a climate where federal regulators are prone to tiptoe through living rooms and boardrooms, leaving the fewest possible footprints in both."

But today the American Dream is being eroded. Since 1976 annual GDP growth per capita (expressed as a 20-year rolling average) has steadily declined, to 1.5% from 2.5%. Why? In part because federal, state and local taxes now consume a whopping 35% of our national output. Current peacetime spending is higher than the 29% peak during World War I; the all-time record was 49% during World War II.
American companies should lead in the reduction of destructive government spending. Eliminating corporate welfare is a moral imperative: We should not be asking senior citizens and the poor to tighten their belts while our government is, actually subsidizes the sale of American chardonnay to the French.
Taxing and spending to support U.S. industry creates a vicious circle. With corporate taxes high, companies lobby for give-backs to remain competitive. Congress faces extreme pressure to ""bring home the pork"" to home-state corporations. That requires even higher taxes -- and the circle continues.
Corporate subsidies are often known by euphemisms such as ""government investments"" or ""government-industry partnerships."" Such Washington-speak notwithstanding, Americans are compelled to pay for silly programs like the proposal by the Commerce Department's Advanced Technology Program to genetically re-engineer cotton, making its fibers more like polyester. Technology subsidies to corporations are sold using technobabble to camouflage unjustifiable investments, which typically fall into four categories:"
842615510,consumer-confidence-plunges-to-two-year-low,wsj_398764622,2000-12-29,"WASHINGTON -- Consumer confidence plunged to its lowest level in two years as the holiday season failed to lift the spirit of Americans rattled by stock-market volatility and mounting fears of a significant economic slowdown.
The Conference Board said consumer confidence slid to 128.3 in December from a revised 132.6 a month earlier. The November reading was initially estimated at 133.5. December's decline marked the third consecutive decrease in the closely watched index, which has lost 14 points since September. The reading compares results with its base year of 1985 when the index was 100. A sharp decrease in household expectations about the future health of the economy accounted for much of the drop.
The New York business-research firm's data are the latest in a string of reports that depict an economy slowing more sharply, and more quickly, than anticipated. The cooling economy has led the Federal Reserve to formally identify slower growth, not inflation, as the biggest current threat to the economy, and analysts expect the central bank to begin cutting interest rates next year to spur growth.
Although most sectors of the economy have begun to slow, the drop in consumer confidence is especially troubling because household fears about a recession can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Consumer spending accounts for nearly two-thirds of the nation's total economic activity; shrinking consumer confidence would probably cause spending to slow. A sharp drop-off in spending then could turn a relatively soft landing into a much bumpier one.
That prospect was very much on the minds of Conference Board officials, who described the fall in confidence as ""somewhat disconcerting."""

The price of gold is back at record levels. But whether it can hit $1,500 in the next few months could depend on whether the U.S. Federal Reserve sticks with an ultraeasy monetary policy that is pushing down the dollar.
Right now, the Fed appears divided over the outlook for its quantitative easing program, known to the market at QE2 and scheduled to end on June 30, and the possibility of higher interest rates later this year, even if U.S. unemployment remains high.
Any fresh signs that the Fed remains concerned about the U.S. economy would boost gold, which is seen as an alternative currency and often attracts strong interest in times of economic uncertainty and unusually low or negative interest rates after adjusting for inflation, as is the case now. An even stronger signal for gold could come from an extension of the Fed's program beyond June, which for now, at least, seems likely.
But any move by the Fed to exit quantitative easing or raise interest rates faster than analysts expect would be detrimental for gold prices, which has come to rely on the U.S.'s super-loose policy. Prices may also come under pressure as investors adjust to life after QE2 and react to any signs that the U.S. economic recovery is gaining traction."

U.S. households saw their wealth decline in the second quarter despite their efforts to save more money, underscoring the economy's struggle to recover from the recession.
The Federal Reserve reported Friday that household net worth--stocks, bonds, homes and other assets, minus mortgages and other debts--fell 2.8% to $53.5 trillion in the second quarter, driven by a sharp decline in the value of stock investments. The drop, the first since the darkest days of the financial crisis in early 2009, left average net worth at about $182,000 a person--though the average is pulled up by a small group of the very wealthy.
The numbers highlight the extent to which erratic financial markets are adding to the job troubles already weighing on consumers. While markets have rebounded somewhat in recent weeks, many people are keeping a lid on spending and focusing on repairing damaged nest eggs.
""I worry every day about our financial future,"" said Steve Gohmann, a 62-year-old retired insurance industry executive.

In 1981 and 1982, Congress cut over $3 billion from food assistance programs. Now it is voting to raise supermarket prices for milk, cheese, meat and bread.
For almost 50 years the federal government has attempted to increase farm income through a combination of programs that limit production and drive food prices up or that make direct payments to farmers when farm prices fall below a certain level. Direct payments tend to have less impact on retail food prices, but they can cost the taxpayer a lot of money. Therefore, it isnâ€™t surprising that, in a time of huge budget deficits, a growing farm crisis and relatively stable food prices. Congress is tempted to adopt a farm program that shifts costs from the citizen as taxpayer to the citizen as consumer.
The House has already succumbed.

Production-control advocates argue that food prices have been quite stable over the past few years, that Americans spend less of their disposable income for food than consumers in other developed nations and that the anticipated food-price increases generated by the farm bill are a reasonable trade-off for preserving the family farm.
They arenâ€™t all wrong. Food prices went up 4 percent last year, and this yearâ€™s increase is expected to be about the same. Our food prices are generally lower than those in other countries. I believe urban America has a stake in maintaining a healthy farm economy."

But the latest gauge, the Labor Department's February producer-price index, which measures prices paid to the nation's farms, factories and refineries, proved inconclusive.
Inflation hawks could cite the index's larger-than-expected 1% increase, the largest monthly advance since October 1990, as evidence that a broader resurgence may be on the horizon. As in previous months, much of that increase stems from a sharp run-up in the cost of energy goods, which soared 7.5%, the biggest gain in almost a decade. Wholesale prices overall were 4% higher than they were in February 1999, the largest year-over-year change in more than 13 months.
On the other hand, the report offers some reason for optimism. Excluding food and energy, prices rose 0.3% for the month, with a 6.3% surge in cigarette prices accounting for all of that increase.

Meanwhile, a separate report from the Labor Department said that producer prices for finished goods increased 0.1 percent in October following a 0.5 percent rise in September. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the producer price index was flat in October after rising 0.4 percent in September.
Despites the increases the Labor Department found in finished goods pricesâ€”those are the prices charged by producers when they first sell a completed itemâ€”analysts said inflation remains well under control, especially so for manufactured products. Over the past 12 months, for instance, the PPI is down 0.2 percent while the core portion of the index, which doesn't include food and energy goods, was up only 0.3 percent.
Even though the two monthly declines in retail sales were small, they left the level of sales lower than their average during the July-September period. With consumer spending, which includes goods and services not sold through retailers, accounting for roughly two-thirds of the gross domestic product, analysts said that recent weakness points to a potentially significant slowdown in economic growth in the final three monthsofthis year."

What would Milton Friedman, the University of Chicago champion of monetary discipline, do now? What would he say -- reversing the charges when he returned a reporter's call, as he always did -- if asked about Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's imminent move to print hundreds of billions of dollars to buy more Treasury bonds to put more money into the economy?
We can't ask him. He died in 2006. ""Friedman,"" says one of his eminent students, Robert Lucas of the University of Chicago, ""was such an original thinker that one could never guess how he would react to a new question."" Nevertheless, this seems a ripe moment to contemplate Friedman's views and those of his disciples.
Friedman believed in the power of money: the more money, the more income and, eventually, the more inflation. He didn't think the Fed could deliver full employment. He regarded interest rates as a misleading measure of whether the Fed was loose or tight.
He didn't trust central bankers. He blamed the Bank of Japan for the deflation of the 1990s and the Fed for the Great Depression of the 1930s and the Great Inflation of the 1970s. He would, if his co-author Anna Schwartz is any clue, have condemned recent bank bailouts."

This dimming retail picture is part of a larger downshift in growth occurring across the economy. Consumer confidence slumped last month and the job market remains weak. On Thursday, the Federal Reserve reported consumer borrowing fell in May, another sign that they are wary about their finances.
All this bodes poorly for the kind of snapback in spending many stores anticipated only a few months ago. Last year's holiday sales were strong and many retailers expected robust growth to continue through this year, fueled in part by pent-up demand for washing machines and clothes that weren't bought during the recession.
The typical retailer has to place orders four months or more in advance of actual sales -- which makes them susceptible in the event that sales fail to materialize or simply grow much more slowly than expected.
Slower growth could mean stores will be stuck with excess inventory. J. Michael Stanley, managing director of Rosenthal & Rosenthal Inc., a specialty lender in the fashion industry known as a factor, says stores have been much more conservative in the orders they place now compared to a few months ago."

The report, which is being released today, takes a number of different measures of the state's high-tech industry -- including its employment, wages and share of exports -- and compares them with those of other states, as well as Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico. The report, funded in part by the Nasdaq Stock Market, also provides an analysis of both high-tech venture-capital investments and research-and-development expenditures.
The association defines high tech using three broad categories: manufacturing, communications services, and software and computer-related services. The definition doesn't include such fields as biotechnology or aerospace.
In high-tech employment, the Lone Star State ranked high: For every 1,000 private-sector workers in 1998, 56 were employed by high-tech firms, or 22% more than the total U.S. share of high-tech employees. That placed Texas 11th in the country in terms of that concentration -- behind such states as California, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.

Since late last year, forecasters have warned that economic growth in 2007 would be weaker than in 2006, due to a slump in housing construction and reduced production by American auto makers. Last year, gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic activity, grew at an inflation-adjusted 3.3%.
However, as the housing and auto slumps have deepened while business spending has started to wane, economists are taking another whack at their GDP forecasts. Earlier this month, the consensus estimate of economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal called for GDP to grow about 2.3% in the first quarter, down from an estimate of 2.5% a month earlier. The forecast for the second quarter was unchanged at 2.4%. One-tenth of a percentage point in GDP amounts to about $13.5 billion.
""The housing recession is likely to be a little deeper and much more prolonged than any of us have been thinking, and capital spending will be considerably weaker,"" said Nariman Behravesh, chief U.S. economist at consulting firm Global Insight, which lowered its forecast of first-quarter GDP growth to 1.6% from 2.2%.
Macroeconomic Advisers, an economic consulting firm based in St. Louis, lowered its forecast to 1.4% from 1.7%. Economists at Morgan Stanley reduced their tracking of first-quarter GDP growth to 1.4% from 1.6% growth; the firm's estimate was as high as 2.2% in mid- March."

So far, incoming September economic reports have been surprisingly firm. Auto sales rebounded to their highest level since April. Chain-store sales posted year-on-year growth of 5.5%. The economy added 103,000 jobs, and manufacturing sentiment improved a bit. On Friday, Commerce Department figures are expected to show a strong 0.8% monthly increase in retail and food-service sales, while consumer sentiment may show some brightening of attitudes as well.
What? If this feels like a 180-degree turn from August, it basically is. It would be one thing if this were a special case, or a broad turning point. But these jerky swings have become the norm. Consider what has happened so far this year: Real gross domestic product shrank in January and February, according to tracking firm Macroeconomic Advisers. Then it surged more than 1% in March. It contracted again in May and June -- only to jump more than 1% again in July.
This isn't typical. Since 1992, monthly GDP has fallen about a third of the time when the economy hasn't been in recession. This year, even assuming a small gain in August, monthly GDP has fallen about half the time. It is even less common to see GDP growth above 1% in any given month; that usually happens only about once a year. In the first half of 2011 alone, it happened twice.
No surprise, then, that stocks have been swinging wildly. After sinking to just shy of bear-market territory, the S&P 500 jumped nearly 8% in the eight trading sessions through Thursday. That rally is predicated in part on figures showing the U.S. is likely to avoid recession for the rest of the year. At least, in traditional terms.

""But we're only going to have room to grow once inflation is contained, and unfortunately the slowdown we're in is what appears to be needed right now to keep inflation in check.""
Labor Department data showed that the cost of materials used by businesses increased 1.2 percent in July and has risen 9.8 percent in the past 12 months. It was the largest yearly increase since 1981, as businesses absorbed sharp cost increases for energy and other commodities.
The report followed recent news that consumer prices also are rising faster than expected -- and faster than the Federal Reserve's generally accepted target rate of around 2 percent. Although wholesale inflation does not necessarily translate into higher consumer prices, it can be indicative of things to come."

Utility stocks have been in the dumps this year, mainly because rising interest rates make their dividends seem less attractive and increase their financing costs. But William F. Klausing, senior vice president of Irving Trust's public utilities division, argues that ""interest rates are less important today than years ago in analyzing"" utility stocks. ""It's a whole new ballgame,"" he adds.
Mr. Klausing's point, echoed by some analysts, is that, after many years of multibillion dollar construction programs, utilities no longer borrow large amounts to build new plants because such investments appear too risky politically. Hence, the expenses of utilities have become less sensitive to interest rates.
To be sure, state regulators are trimming utilities' authorized rates of return -- and hence their profit potential -- in response to interest rate declines in the past few years. But, analysts note, many utilities have become units of holding companies. Profit from these publicly traded firms' non-regulated operations -- and from sales of electricity in the wholesale or bulk-power market -- have become important to a company's overall profitability.
So what should the savvy investor look for in an electric-utility stock?"

The day after Thanksgiving -- commonly called Black Friday -- is a key barometer of holiday spending, when retailers traditionally turn a profit. Retailers managed to rouse many shoppers out of bed through aggressive discounts in key categories such as electronics, toys and apparel, but consumers kept a close eye on their own bottom lines.
Economists are closely watching this holiday season because the depth of the financial slowdown could depend on consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70 percent of the gross domestic product. The next few weeks are also a make-or-break period for retailers because they count on holiday sales to help pay their costs the rest of the year.

But Sen. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.) wants to revive that notion, which has lain dormant for more than a decade because there has been so little inflation. ""I am concerned about inflation down the road,"" he explains. ""The time is right for us to bring clarity to the Fed."" In the House, Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) and Michael Pence (R., Ind.) agree. Mr. Pence argues that the Fed's quest to combat unemployment by buying $600 billion in U.S. Treasurys is a failure and threatens to ""monetize our debt and trigger inflation.""
The implication is that the Fed has lost its moorings. Has it really? For more than 30 years, Congress has charged the Fed with aiming at ""maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates."" That wording has long made some Fed officials and academic economists uneasy because it is rooted in a now-abandoned view that the government could dial up a little more inflation to get a little less unemployment and vice versa.
The current consensus is that the Fed can -- and, indeed, is now attempting to -- reduce unemployment in a recession, but in the long run can deliver only price stability. What Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke calls ""the longer-run sustainable unemployment rate"" is determined by demographics, job-market rules and other factors beyond the Fed's control. In this view, if the Fed tried to push unemployment too low now, it could create too much inflation later, the mistake the Fed made in the late 1970s.
But it is not the 1970s. Even though the Fed has been holding short-term interest rates near zero for nearly two years, prices rose at only a 1% annual rate in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. No measure of inflation expectations foresees anything like the 8%-plus inflation of the '70s. And it's hard to find a single Greenspan or Bernanke decision that would have been different if they had an inflation-only mandate. So why all this now?"

Without a big drop in auto sales, retail sales would have posted a 0.3 percent increase last month, and analysts said that figure was more reflective of consumer sentiment.

The unemployment rate has been falling swiftly, dropping to 6.3% in May from 7.5% a year earlier. But there's an open question about how much slack there is in the job market. Some 37.2% of the working-age population is out of the labor force now, compared with 34% when the recession started in 2007. And while some of those people lost to the labor pool will likely return, some, such as those nearing retirement age and those whose skills have eroded, may never come back.
At Wednesday's news conference following the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting this week, Chairwoman Janet Yellen indicated that for her, an important sign the labor market is tightening will be when wages are increasing more rapidly. So far, that hasn't been happening. Average hourly earnings were up just 2.1% in May versus a year earlier, and the Labor Department on Tuesday reported that, when adjusted for inflation, they were actually a shade lower.
But companies think they will soon be paying more. This month, a quarterly survey conducted by Duke University and CFO Magazine showed that U.S. chief financial officers expect wages and salaries at their companies to increase 3% over the next 12 months.

So many employers are like Frank Hearl Jr. of the Dulles Airport Marriott, based in a suburb where nearly everybody already has a job.
A job fair yesterday in the Reeves Center, at 14th and U streets NW, brought together people like Walker and Hearl in an attempt to solve a problem faced by the region for decades: Most new jobs are in the suburbs, while most of the unemployed are in the city.
More than 650 applicants from the city, where unemployment is 6 percent, showed up for about 500 jobs in the Dulles corridor, where unemployment is less than 1.5 percent.
Putting city job seekers in touch with suburban recruiters was only part of the plan, since even when District residents know of work outside the Capital Beltway, many have no way of getting there. So the job fair was timed to coincide with Monday's start of a Metro bus route between L'Enfant Plaza and Dulles International Airport. The buses are to run hourly from 5:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m., seven days a week, with fares of $1.10 each way.

This month's WSJ.com economic-forecasting survey showed projections for gross domestic product and employment growth were cut, while forecasts for consumer prices and oil prices were lifted. Economists continued to nudge higher their estimates of the probability of a recession over the next 12 months; on average, they put the likelihood at 26%, up from 20% in June and 15% in February.
Economists, on average, forecast GDP growth at a 2.8% annual rate for the third quarter, the first time their forecast for that quarter has been under 3% since the economic-forecasting survey first asked about the period in November 2005. While their forecast is slightly above the 2.5% real GDP growth recorded in the second quarter, it is well below the 5.6% growth in the first quarter and average annual growth rate of 3.2% from 2003 to 2005. The economists forecast growth slowing to a 2.6% rate in the fourth quarter, and staying at that rate for the first half of 2007. GDP is the broadest measure of economic output.
""The economy has definitely slowed below trend,"" said Ethan Harris at Lehman Brothers. ""Second-quarter GDP is soft, employment numbers are coming in soft and the housing market is finally softening.""
Oil prices remained at the forefront of concerns, as 43% of economists -- 20 of the 46 who answered the question -- indicated higher costs presented the biggest risk to their GDP outlook. At the same time, the average year-end forecast for crude-oil prices was lifted to $69.50 a barrel. That is up by more than $4 since the last survey, conducted in June, but below the recent level of oil prices, which have traded in the mid-$70s this week. The economists expect prices to drop to $65.25 by next June."

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development -- which publishes comparable social and economic stats for some 30 countries -- reported Wednesday that the U.S. economic slowdown will be significant, as the real estate crisis continues. Housing ""is set to exert a longer and more potent than expected drag"" on the U.S. economy, said Jean-Philippe Cotis, chief economist for the Paris-based economic think tank. Consumers will also be tested by ""mortgage rate resets, tighter credit standards, weaker collaterals and slower job creation."" In a press briefing, Mr. Costis also said he expects the Federal Reserve to ease rates sooner rather than later. Another ominous, yet inconclusive, indicator of the direction of the U.S. economy out early Wednesday, the ADP National Employment Report, said that jobs in the private sector rose by 38,000 in August, much less than expectations. This data tidbit shined one of the first statistical spotlights on the economy in August, when the worries over exposure to subprime securities spooked investors out of credit markets. Still, Goldman Sachs economists warned that the ADP report ""gives a picture of the labor market for the week of Aug. 12, only part way through the market turmoil and before employment could really react to the ongoing credit crunch. More weakness could well be yet to come.""
Also out Wednesday were housing numbers from the National Association of Realtors. The group's index of pending sales of existing homes decreased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 12.2% in July from June, the industry group said Wednesday. The NAR index, based on signed contracts for previously owned homes, was 16.1% below the level of July 2006. An NAR statement accompanying the data release also suggested existing-home sales will likely sag more as mortgage disruptions tied to credit concerns work their way into the housing market. BNP Paribas economists noted that ""most worryingly is that this report is clearly 'pre-turmoil', reflecting resale transactions agreed in July, so before August's financial market turmoil, lurch higher in jumbo mortgage rates and the freezing over of much of the mortgage market. How bad next month's pending sales index (and this month's new home sales report) might be is really quite frightening."" Still more economic reports are on tap for later today, when the Federal Reserve will release its ""beige book"" report. Concerns over the credit crunch and statements from Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke last week will put extra weight on the regularly published collection of on-the-ground business anecdotes from the Fed's 12 regional banks.
Housing figures proved particularly difficult for investors to digest, and major indexes reversed course after Tuesday's rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 172.74, or 1.28%, just after midday to 13276.12. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 18.62, or 1.25%, to 1470.80 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index was down 20.41, or 0.78%, to 2609.83. Treasury prices gained, with the 10- year note rising to yield 4.484% after midday. The 30-year bond was up to yield 4.875%. Crude prices were up five cents to $75.13. The dollar weakened against the yen and the euro. Shares in Europe sank and Asian markets closed mixed.

The figures reflected a healthy U.S. economy. But analysts expect the gap to widen in the months ahead, with export sales slowing. February exports rose to a record $73.46 billion from $70.65 billion a month earlier. Imports rose more slowly, to less than $84 billion from $83.31 billion in January.
Early yesterday, the Commerce Department reported the February deficit at $11.59 billion but changed its numbers in the evening after rechecking the figures. It said that ""data-reporting errors at several ports of entry"" caused a $1.1 billion overcount when tallying crude-oil imports for the month. After seasonal adjustments, it added, the February deficit was recalculated at $10.4 billion.
The department said a complete revision of the figures will be released today.
Even the relatively small rise in imports prompted many economists to scale back their optimistic estimates of gross-domestic-product growth for the first quarter. Surprisingly strong reports on consumer spending and industrial production had led to ""a consensus number for the first quarter of 4.5% growth,"" said Chris Varvares, an economist with Macroeconomic Advisors in St. Louis, well above the strong 3.8% growth in the fourth quarter.

Among exports, industrial supplies also posted a big increase in the first quarter.

Overall, exports increased 9.8% to $74.67 billion in the latest quarter from $68.01 billion in the previous period.
U.S. exports have benefited from the dollar's decline in foreign currency trading over the past three years. A lower dollar makes imports more expensive and U.S. products more competitive overseas.
Imports increased 1.3% to $110.62 billion from $109.21 billion. The figures benefited from an 11.6% drop in imports of petroleum and related products. The decline was due to lower prices, as shipments rose. Big increases came in nonelectrical machinery and passenger cars from Canada and South Korea. Auto imports from Japan and West Germany fell."

Such action seemed highly unlikely at the central bank's April meeting, when forecasts for growth and employment were brightening. At their policy meeting this month, Fed officials will weigh whether the U.S. economic outlook is deteriorating enough to justify new measures to boost growth, according to interviews and Fed speeches.
The Fed's next meeting, June 19 and 20, could be too soon for conclusive decisions. Fed policy makers have many unanswered questions and have had trouble forming consensus in the past. Top Fed officials have said that they would support new measures if they became convinced the U.S. wasn't making progress on bringing down unemployment. Recent disappointing employment reports have raised this possibility, but the data might be a temporary blip. Moreover, the Fed's options for more easing are sure to stir internal resistance at the central bank if they are considered.
Their options include doing nothing and continuing to assess the economic outlook--or more strongly signaling a willingness to act later if the outlook more clearly worsens. Fed policy makers could take a small precautionary measure, like extending for a short period its ""Operation Twist"" program, in which the Fed is selling short-term securities and using the proceeds to buy long-term securities. Or, policy makers could take bolder action such as launching another large round of bond purchases if they become convinced of a significant slowdown.
The landscape for the Fed is complicated by the presidential election. Mindful of his own legacy and the Fed's independence, Chairman Ben Bernanke seems unlikely to allow the political calendar to sway his decisions. He appears especially immune from politics now, with just 18 months left in his term as chairman and little indication that he wants another. Still, some investors speculate the Fed has an incentive to decide quickly to avoid shifting policies close to the November vote."

Nineteen years ago, when he had just lost a Senate race in Texas, Bush was looking for work. Come to the White House as congressional liaison, suggested Richard Nixon, who had encouraged the Texas race. No thanks, said Bush, uninterested in a staff job. Well, how about the United Nations? Okay, said Bush, and with that he launched an international career that put him on the road to the presidency.
But what did Bush himself want in those days? Sources from the Nixon White House say that he had an entirely different path in mind, far from diplomacy and maybe even politics. His first choice was a top post at the Treasury Department, drawing upon his days as an oilman and as a member of the House Ways and Means Committee. Bush hoped that Nixon would eventually make him secretary of the treasury, where he could spruce up the American economy.
Though he hasn't been a close student of the economy since then, Bush could now serve both himself and the country if he returned to his old interest in economic affairs. Not this week, nor this month, but by fall, he should come to the country with a giant plan for economic renewal. For both Bush and the economy, this is an ideal time to strike.
Over the past four weeks, Bush has vaulted into his strongest political position since taking office. His arms proposal in Europe not only transformed his first serious trip overseas but seemed to liberate him from a cautious past. Since then he has put together a string of successes: his deft handling of the China crisis, a clean-air proposal, blockage of a minimum-wage proposal and House passage of most of his S&L bailout plan. A Gallup Poll taken in early June showed his popularity climbing 14 points to a 70 percent approval rating-and that was before his call for cleaner air, a sure winner. After a dangerously slow start, Bush may now begin a second honeymoon.
By chance, the president has seized the high ground just as Congress is falling off the charts in public esteem, badly damaged by the uproar over ethics, pay and unprecedented resignations. While the Democrats have now elected stronger House leaders, they are likely to be far more conciliatory than anyone imagined six months ago. Reagan was more formidable than Bush in his first year, but he could never fully reverse the post-Vietnam flow of power away from the White House. Bush just might-if he now moves to set a more ambitious agenda."

For the third consecutive year, global growth was strong, continuing to lift (and hold) millions of people out of poverty.

In relative terms, the first five years of the current recovery have been much better than the first five years of the 1990s recovery. But all this has not softened the pessimism of many pundits and politicians who are either unimpressed or expect the whole thing to come crashing down any minute. That is, unless the government firmly grabs the reins of the global economy and steers it clear of disaster.
Many believe that the debate is over on global warming, nationalized health care, tax hikes, rich-versus-poor, the trade deficit and ""obscene"" oil company profits. Forgotten in this rush to pass judgment on capitalism is the fact that the last two times government seriously tried to control the U.S. economy -- in the 1930s and in the 1970s -- they made a terrible mess of it.
In the 1930s, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act caused a collapse in global trade, while the Fed allowed the money supply to shrink by one- third. Government regulation in the 1920s prevented banks from branching, which caused more than 10,000 to fail in the 1930s, deepening and prolonging the Great Depression. Herbert Hoover's tax hikes were icing on the cake, capping off a perfect storm of D.C. policy mistakes.
It took another 35 years, and a nice run of prosperity, but Washington finally gathered the courage to try this again. Between 1965 and 1981, Great Society welfare and health-care programs, wage and price controls, inflationary Fed policy, 70% marginal tax rates, 50% capital-gains tax rates, and highly regulated energy, airline, banking and trucking industries created severe problems.

That's the midyear consensus of 40 economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal. Although the recession is ending, they say, the recovery will be much weaker than the typical rebound since World War II. Many predict little or no change in the unemployment rate over the next several months.
Indeed, many analysts say the difference between recovery and recession will be so subtle that people who aren't economists may have difficulty seeing it.
""A lot of business people are saying to me: What recovery?"" says Stuart Hoffman, senior vice president at PNC Financial Corp. in Pittsburgh. That's likely to remain a reasonable question all year, he says, because there are ""many speed bumps that will keep us moving very slowly on the road to recovery.""
Stiff tax increases imposed by many state and local governments this year are among the economic speed bumps Mr. Hoffman and many other analysts cite.

However, the timing of last weekâ€™s decision to reduce the Federal Reserve discount rate carried considerable significance.
The weekly Dorsey statements of the banks in principal cities have made it clear that the demand by business for bank loans has been quite sluggish in the past few months, after making allowance for the usual seasonal tendencies of the late summer and autumn. But there has been a continued demand for funds in the capital markets. Consequently, interest rates have been only slightly below the recent highs â€” which have been around the highest rates in over 20 years.
The latest rate for new 91-day Treasury Bills was about 3.47 per cent, only slightly below the then prevailing discount rate of 3.5 per cent and well above the new discount rate of 3 per cent. Jn theory, the new condition would seem to encourage member banks to borrow from the Federal Reserve Banks at 3 per cent and use the funds to buy bills at 3.45 per cent, which would, of course, tend to expand bank credit.
A reduction of the discount rate below the bill rate is a most unusual development, in fact, I cannot find a duplication of it in the record of the past 25 years.
THE MOVE is all the more startling because public remarks made by FRB Chairman Martin only about two w'eeks ago were bluntly in defense of the tight credit policy, and his observations then would seem to justify the publicâ€™s interpretation that the tight credit policy was likely to continue."

And with the market off 5.92% last week, and despite yesterday's 96 point recovery, a lot of earthbound traders are getting aggrieved that Alan Greenspan hadn't pulled the interest-rate cord for them earlier. Now they're worried it's ""too late,"" that inflation is loose and they're headed for a fall.
It's not overwhelmingly clear to us that inflation's back. Maybe the wholesale price jump was only a blip. But bond traders, like canaries in a coal mine, are worth watching. There are enough worrisome signs around that this is a good moment to start thinking seriously about what's beyond the economic horizon for the U.S. economy. Robert Mundell, the supply-side economist who just won the Nobel Prize, already has the near term in mind. Interviewed last week he said, ""I don't see any indication of a slowdown in the U.S. economy in the present, but I would not be surprised if that occurred next year.""
Now when we say serious thinking about the near term, that includes Presidential candidates who will be running full tilt next year. What if inflation indeed shows up and the Fed feels impelled to tighten, even at risk of a downturn during the election campaign? If the person heading for the White House inherits a stalling U.S. economy, voters will want an answer. The answer isn't, ""I plan to stay within the spending caps."" That's a Beltway thing; it's not an economic strategy.
A real economic strategy is aimed at boosting the real economy, whose state of health is anticipated by stock and bond markets. In this world, what one watches are prices, which direct goods and investments to their most productive uses. Inflation disincentivizes that process, and the concern of late is that some relevant prices have been blipping upward.
The price of oil, for instance, has more than doubled the past 12 months, owing in great part to the oil-producing nations' ability this time to hang together on prices. They're helped by a number of factors, such as the participation of Mexico. But OPEC's success can also be read as a sign of accommodative monetary policies."
842615370,review-&-outlook-(editorial):-greenspan's-recovery,wsj_398211335,1991-07-09,"The White House says the recession is over, and the anecdotal evidence suggests a recovery has begun. The lackluster response in financial markets, however, suggests widespread doubts that policy makers in Washington have a clue about how to sustain a recovery.
Specifically, markets have to be wondering about the delay in reappointing Alan Greenspan as chairman of the Federal Reserve. Colin Powell's first term as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff expires in the autumn, and President Bush announced his reappointment a month ago. Mr. Greenspan's four-year term expires in a month, but Mr. Bush has made no announcement. Meanwhile, various aides, deputies and kibitzers tell reporters that the delay is an attempt to ""leverage"" the Fed to ease interest rates further.
This sounds all too much like the same advisers who urged Mr. Bush to raise taxes three months into this recession. Having abandoned their own control over fiscal policy, these advisers have since taken to lecturing Mr. Greenspan and the Fed on monetary policy. This is graceless at the least, but also probably dangerous; financial markets can see when stones are being thrown from glass houses in Washington.
Especially since Mr. Greenspan is the one U.S. official who has built some credibility in world markets lately. Amid the capital's fiscal gridlock, the Fed has had to steer the economy with its single monetary oar, and with fair results. The Fed has brought down long-term interest rates, which are the decisive rates for investment. It's done this without reigniting inflation, which except during Paul Volcker's Fed tenure, has been the expectation before every presidential election cycle.
It's true that, at 8.5% or so, long-term interest rates remain stubbornly high. But this isn't something the Fed can easily control. The Fed in the short run can dictate the fed-funds rate, which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans. And the Greenspan Fed has done this, dropping fed-funds to 5.75% April 30."

Only months after state lawmakers in February had to raise taxes and slash spending to close a $42 billion budget deficit, legislators in May will begin work on filling a new multibillion-dollar shortfall.
A state agency projects an additional $8 billion budget gap for the fiscal year that ends in July 2010, a result of declining tax revenue amid the recession. The figure could grow if revenue plummets further.
And it could get worse yet if voters defeat a series of ballot measures on May 19 aimed at closing the earlier deficit. That is a possibility, as a March 25 poll by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California shows 50% of Californians against Proposition 1C, which would allow the state to borrow $5 billion against future lottery revenue, versus 37% who support it.
The proposition's backers, who include Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and legislative leaders, said they expect increased support for the measures as they begin campaigning. ""As they step back and we get information to them, they'll say, 'You know what, this makes sense,'"" said Republican Mike Villines, the Assembly's minority leader.

The record drop in heating oil prices last month followed a 26.3% jump in January. Overall energy prices fell 0.7% in February after jumping 5.1% in January.

Those concerns have subsided and money is again flowing into corporate bond funds, giving managers cash to invest.
Risk premiums, the extra interest corporate borrowers pay over U.S. Treasurys, are falling again for corporate bonds. This allows companies to seize the opportunity to borrow cheaply.

This would be a very big mistake. It assumes that voters are ready to forgive President Reagan for his ill-conceived Economic Recovery Program, that supply-side fantasy that sent the economy into a tailspin, idling 33 percent of the nationâ€™s productive capacity, driving unemployment up to 12 million, creating over $400 billion in deficits, boosting mortgage interest to 18 percent and, in the process, forcing cutbacks in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, food stamps and unemployment compensation.
That sort of polity, and the pall it cast over the economy until last summer, are not so quickly forgotten. The way Democrats can keep the issue alive is by pointing to the next four years. Long after the need for a shift in economic policy became imperative, Reagan was the one who insisted on â€œstaying the course.â€ù So it is almost certain that, at the first sign of renewed inflation, a second Reagan administration would send the average American through the economic wringer again. All of those who lost their jobs before would be out on the street again.
If this does not have the makings of an effective election issue, I donâ€™t know one when I see it. With some of the best media experts in the country on their side, such as Norman Lear, David Sawyer, Tony Schwartz and Robert Squier, the Democrats can present the economic issue in countless and ingenious ways.
There is an even better reason for Democrats to stress the home front this year. The party out of power takes a real risk when it campaigns on foreign policy.

When we wonder about the slowness of the current job recovery, we should be thinking about all the government actions that interfere with job creation, including payroll taxes, protectionist quotas and subsidies to favored businesses, excessive regulations that weaken our companies, massive federal spending and deficits, and overly generous unemployment benefits that subsidize voluntary unemployment and discourage employment flexibility.

When it came to fiscal strategy, however, there was almost no daylight among them. Each candidate decried the rise of government spending and wants to cut taxes.
Again and again they noted that spending under President Obama rose to 25% of the economy in 2009, the highest in decades and well over the 20%-21% norm of the last 30 years.
To hear the GOP candidates tell it, this fact explains the deficit, explains America's long-run fiscal problem, and explains why new taxes cannot be tolerated. Congressional Republicans have the same outlook. The deficit is up thanks to government spending, so we must cut spending right now in every form.
Yet the long-run fiscal problem facing the country--which is real--has almost nothing to do with the reasons that the deficit is currently large or that spending is abnormally high. They are high for the same reason taxes are abnormally low: because of the economic downturn. We should debate the real issues, not try to pretend the recession never happened.
The Congressional Budget Office forecast a $1.2 trillion deficit before the Obama administration even came into office. The stimulus added only around $250 billion a year, and more than one-third of that came from tax cuts, especially the tax credit in the stimulus bill's ""Making Work Pay"" provision."
830982098,the-heavy-cost-of-continued-inflation,wapo_148113028,1971-01-12,"Regardless of any mitigating qualifications that may be read into it, the unemployment of 6 per cent of the national labor force in December is a sobering commentary on the economic transition through which the United States is passing. Undoubtedly it does reflect in part the winding down of the war in Vietnam. In larger measure it is a product of the economic slowdown deliberately brought about to curb an alarming rise in inflation. The specific cause in any particular case will not lessen the distress of jobless families, however, and that distress is now sufficiently widespread to make corrective measures imperative.
The classical method of dealing with inflation has always had an ironic twist. The curtailment of economic activity to relieve the upward pressure on prices has exacted sacrifices from those least able to bear them. This time, moreover, the irony has multiplied. While 4.6 million unemployed are tightening their belts because of the scarcity of jobs, millions of other workers are taking advantage of the continued inflation to boost their incomes, with little or no regard for what the general consequences may be.
In addition to this special toll exacted from people who lose their jobs, the economic trends of the last year have been rough on a large majority of wage earners. Hourly pay has advanced over the last year by 5.8 per cent, but the cost of living in November was 5.6 per cent above the figure a year ago. In other words, almost the entire increase was eaten up by higher prices, with no allowance for the rise in worker productivity, which is now increasing again.
last year. Department of Labor statistics for the first nine months of 1970, the latest available, show â€œa mean wage and benefit package adjustment of 10 per cent a year.â€ù The average first-year wage and benefit change during that same period amounted to 14.7 per cent a year. Economists recognize these exorbitant wage increases in some key industries as a leading cause of continued inflation even in the face of lax economic activity.
One segment of labor, the unemployed, is taking a severe drubbing from the current economic situation while another, the large powerful unions, is riding the crest of excessive benefits for its own members. The sacrifice imposed on workers at the bottom of the scale for the sake of attaining a stable economy is proving to be ineffective in part because of the extraordinary power exerted by other labor groups at the top of the scale."

In fact, the Fed has behaved in a way completely consistent with Chairman Ben Bernanke's public comments, at least since July. A careful look at the labor market numbers suggests that if the Fed sticks to the chairman's words, there will be no significant tapering any time soon.
Before July, the Fed announced on a number of occasions that a 6.5% unemployment rate would indicate that it is time to start raising interest rates and winding down its easy-money policies. The unemployment rate has fallen significantly from its high of 10% in October 2009 to the mid-sevens. But the labor market is still sickly because, as I pointed out in these pages in June, the employment rate--the proportion of the working-age population that has jobs--has made little progress.
The employment rate is the best single indicator of labor-market health, and it is still hovering at around 58.5%, down significantly from its pre-recession levels of over 63%. The economy is adding jobs, but just barely staying ahead of population growth. Rather than making up for ground lost during the recession, the economy is still treading water.
Mr. Bernanke and other Fed governors are clearly aware of the distinction between the unemployment and employment rates. In his July 17 congressional testimony, Mr. Bernanke said that ""if a substantial part of the reductions in measured unemployment were judged to reflect cyclical declines in labor force participation rather than gains in employment (my emphasis), the [Federal Open Market] Committee would be unlikely to view a decline in unemployment to 6.5% as a sufficient reason to raise its target for the federal funds rate."" The jobs report for August showed the decline in labor-force participation and employment rates that the Fed feared.
On Sept. 18--following the FOMC's vote to continue its current pace of bond-buying--Mr. Bernanke reinforced the message. ""The unemployment rate is not necessarily a great measure in all circumstances of the state of the labor market overall,"" he said. ""We are looking for overall improvement in the labor market."""

Markets across the Continent slumped Monday, a reminder that the euro zone's own debt woes remain far from resolved.

Besides Italy, Spain--another worrying spot in the euro zone--also had a rough day; the Madrid stock market closed down 3.2%.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) recently highlighted the idea, which is known as ""chained CPI,"" as an example of the kind of changes needed to avert spending cuts and tax increases set to begin in January. House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) included it in his recent deficit-reduction proposal.
President Barack Obama has in the past signaled openness to switching inflation measures to shore up Social Security. And several centrist Democrats have endorsed the idea, too.
But as with much of the ""fiscal cliff"" negotiations, nothing is as simple it appears. Even this seemingly technical change has become caught in the ideological gaps between the two sides.
Under the Republicans' proposal, the government would stop pegging benefits to versions of the consumer price index that measure the change in prices for a hypothetical fixed basket of goods, the standard measure of inflation. Instead, the government would use the chain-weighted CPI, which tends to rise slower because it recognizes that consumers will buy less of goods whose prices are rising rapidly. For example, if the price of chicken rises more than the price of beef, families might buy less chicken and more beef."

That combination means trouble for policy makers who want to jump-start the economy with lower interest rates, but worry that lower rates could also stimulate inflation.
Industrial production in November plunged 1.7%, following decreases of 0.9% in October and 0.1% in September, the Federal Reserve Board reported. The November cutback was the biggest in a single month since production dropped 2% in January 1982.
A 21.5% drop in auto and truck production, along with declines in other areas related to car manufacturing, accounted for more than half the loss in the month. Businesses also shut down a big chunk of productive capacity; industry operated at 80.9% of capacity in November, down from 82.4% in October. The November rate was the lowest since May 1987.

The rally was fueled partly by speculation that government figures to be released today will show that the economy was weaker in the third quarter than had been expected. If so, that could arouse renewed concern that the economy is sinking into a recession, intensifying pressure on the Federal Reserve System to drive down short-term interest rates further.
Most analysts are expecting the Commerce Department today to report that the economy grew at about a 2.5% annual rate in the third quarter. That would be an improvement from the second quarter's dismal 0.6% rate, after adjusting for inflation. A few analysts even say third-quarter growth exceeded 3%.

Per-hour work output in the non-farm economy rose at a 1% annual rate in the second period, the department said, double the 0.5% rate estimated last month, but still relatively low.
The change in the figure primarily reflects the revision the Commerce Department announced last week in its second-quarter estimate of the nation's total production, or gross national product. The revision put GNP growth at a modest 2% annual rate, up from the 1.7% rate calculated in July. The Commerce Department said the upward revision mostly was due to a larger-than-expected rise in inventories during June.
The revised second-quarter productivity gain is based on a 2.2% increase in non-farm output and a 1.2% increase in hours worked. The earlier estimate was based on a 1.9% increase in output and a 1.4% increase in hours. All the figures represent seasonally adjusted annual rates.
The latest productivity figures continue a pattern of peaks and valleys that characterize economic growth in the later stages of an economic cycle. Productivity generally rises sharply in the early stages of a business recovery and then tapers off as employers hire more workers. Productivity spurted at a 7.1% annual rate in the 1983 second quarter. Lately, as corporations have been reducing the number of employees or cutting their work schedules, productivity has seesawed from quarter to quarter."

It is as if the free market has absolutely nothing to do with it, as if small businesses aren't the most important engine for economic growth in this country and never have been.

The department's employment cost index, which covers wages, salaries and fringe benefits, increased 1.2 percent in the third quarter and 3.4 percent in the 12 months ended in September, the department said.
Many forecasters and financial market participants, concerned about a possible acceleration of inflation, have been watching various measures of wages to spot any indication that labor costs have begun to increase more rapidly. Unless productivity-output per hour worked-also rose, a faster rate of wage change likely would mean higher inflation. Some expected that lower unemployment would raise employment costs by increasing competition to hire workers.
However, the quarterly increase in the index was almost identical to a 1.1 percent rise in the third quarter of last year. The index rose 0.7 percent in the second quarter, but because the figures are not adjusted for seasonal variation, comparing changes from one quarter to the next may be misleading.
For the 12 months ended in June, the increase was 3.3 percent, slightly less than the 3.4 percent in the year ended in September. For the year ended in September 1986, the rise was 3.6 percent."

A case in point was earlier this month, up on Capitol Hill, when he held forth on the mundane but vital issue of pricing.
""A striking feature"" of the current economic cycle, the Fed chairman said, ""has been the virtual absence of pricing power across much of American business.""
Well said, Mr. Chairman. Raising prices has always been an art form, but these days it is approaching the status of a lost art form. Yes, there are the usual suspects that can achieve ""pricing power"" in good times and bad. They tend to be the rare ""service"" providers without global competition: universities that raise tuition; hospitals jacking up fees; or near monopolies such as cable-television operators. Indeed, cable-TV giant Comcast Corp. has raised prices steadily all through the economic downturn, and in some markets, Comcast prices are up 15% since mid-2000.
But for every business operating in a Comcast-type world these days, many more operate in what might be called a Wal-Mart world of flat or falling prices. Wal-Mart is famous for extracting ever-lower prices from its global army of suppliers. In turn, this forces suppliers to stay profitable by means of productivity gains instead of price increases. It's a powerful force that James Smith, an economist at the University of North Carolina, dubs ""the Wal-Martization of the U.S. economy.""
Thus, as the economy gathers strength, there's a big question looming. When will the discounting, rebating and price-cutting reverse course?

The stage was set by a painfully negotiated deal between the White House and Democrats, announced last week, on the terms of trade in pending agreements with Peru and Panama. Those agreements with two small nations are just the overture for a much larger debate involving tariff-cutting deals with Colombia and South Korea. And then comes the monumental question of whether to give President Bush the same free hand that his predecessors have enjoyed in negotiating global and regional trade agreements, not amendable by Congress but subject only to an up-or-down vote.
Before last week, there was no chance that a Democratic Congress would trust Bush to look out for the interests of American firms and workers in any such negotiations. Now there is a chance -- but only a chance -- that the United States will be able to take its usual leadership role in moving the world toward an open trading system.
What created this opportunity was that after months of saying no, the lead negotiators for the White House, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab finally said yes to the inclusion of labor and environmental guarantees in the body of the trade agreements.

842616960,the-outlook:-an-economic-slowdown-brings-its-problems,wsj_397922758,1984-06-25,"NEW YORK -- The financial markets for weeks have been hoping for an economic slowdown. The economy has been roaring along at a pace that makes analysts worry about a future upsurge of inflation. Some of the statistics suggest that a slowdown of sorts may be under way, but this slowdown is likely to create more problems than it solves.
To begin with, it isn't much of a slowdown. The Commerce Department in its flash report last week estimated that the inflation-adjusted gross national product will rise by 5.7% in the quarter ending June 30. At the same time the department revised upward its figure for the first quarter from 8.8% to 9.7%. Going from 9.7% to 5.7% is a slowdown but not an impressive one.
The big first-quarter number stemmed largely from inventory-building by businessmen, who had been slow to recognize that an old-fashioned boom was under way. Purchases for inventory apparently have been lower in the current quarter, but little else is slowing down.
As usual, high interest rates are beginning to bite into housing. Sales of new homes have declined, and last week the Commerce Department reported that new housing starts declined 10.5% in May. Industrial production rose more slowly in May.
Otherwise, a boom seems to be rolling. Edward S. Hyman Jr., an economist at the brokerage firm of Cyrus J. Lawrence, watches a ""revisions index."" Government statistical agencies are constantly revising their numbers on the basis of late information. When the numbers steadily head upward, Mr. Hyman sees a trend toward strength. The numbers on the first-quarter gross national product, in order, were 7.2%, 8.3%, 8.8% and now 9.7%."

These policies aren't working. They discourage private investment and jobs, and the policies have resulted in high unemployment, weak business confidence and rapidly declining median incomes.
The signature of our times is the fever for investing in government bonds and $1,700-an-ounce gold rather than in job creation and small businesses. That is the market's response to Obama administration efforts to reverse core American principles of growth and prosperity.
These principles include a sound dollar to provide price stability and to attract capital; a commitment to limited government as a prerequisite for higher living standards; a preference for low tax rates to encourage investment and hiring; and a belief that markets can set prices and allocate capital better than governments.
The administration will have spent more than $14 trillion in just four years and added $6 trillion to the national debt. The Federal Reserve has dramatically expanded its role in the economy and markets, practically creating a new branch of government. Its near-zero interest-rate policy favors government, the world's biggest borrower, at the expense of private-sector savers. The Fed's heavily leveraged purchases of government bonds work against the market-based allocation of capital that is a key driver of economic growth. The Fed has now promised to make unlimited future purchases of government debt if job growth remains weak, an affront to the principle of limited government."

In September, he filled his portfolio with paper companies and makers of heavy trucks, companies that do well when the economy is growing. ""This is a classic cyclical recovery,"" he says.
While share prices have moved up, so have earnings. ""Valuations,"" he adds, ""are exactly where they were"" at the beginning of the year.""We have just had the most massive stimulus ever,"" Mr. Kagan notes, referring to the windfall combination of low interest rates, rapid monetary growth and generous tax cuts.
But the feel-good factor seen through the summer could easily be replaced by renewed doubts. ""It is a fairly abnormal environment,"" says Bruce Kasman, chief U.S. economist for J.P. Morgan Securities. ""Low interest rates have some medicinal effects. They help, but they aren't a permanent fix for everything.""
Still, even after the recent stock-market declines, the alternatives are lousy. Bank deposits earning less than 2%? No thanks. A return on 10-year Treasurys under 4%? Please. Besides, Chevron Texaco Corp. pays a dividend close to that, and the tax on that dividend has just been cut to 15%.

Some analysts said they thought the stock market drop likely would cause the Fed to lower the federal funds rateâ€”the key interest rate financial institutions charge one another for overnight loansâ€”from about 9 percent to 8.75 percent or a bit less.
But Federal Reserve officials, like their counterparts elsewhere in government, are waiting to see whether the market decline re- i sumes. Since the economy is much i less buoyant now than it was prior 1 to the stock market crash in October 1987, any depressing impact from falling stock prices on consumer spending or business investment could virtually eliminate growth.
Over the weekend, unidentified senior Federal Reserve officials said the central bank would supply cash to the banking system to reassure investors adequate credit would be available if loans were needed as a result of falling stock prices.
But other Fed officials were uncomfortable with the published comments, arguing that they all but forced the central bank to add cash to the banking system yesterday even if it was not needed.

842615154,the-economy:-april's-employment-data-show-third-straight-month-of-job-cuts,wsj_398980295,2003-05-05,"Companies continued to shed workers in April, and the latest data gave little indication that a significant job-market rebound is imminent.
In its latest monthly employment report, the Labor Department said U.S. nonagricultural companies eliminated 48,000 payroll jobs last month, following a combined decline of 477,000 jobs in February and March. Although the decline wasn't as steep as some had expected, other statistics in the report clearly suggested that the labor market is weaker than many economists anticipated.
For example, job losses in the manufacturing sector were enormous; jobs fell 95,000 in April. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, rose to 6% from 5.8%. Most troublesome, the average workweek fell 0.3 hour, an indication that companies don't have enough work to occupy even those employees that remain after the latest cuts. Many economists say hiring will pick up only after there is an uptick in hours worked, since companies generally try to make their existing employees work longer before they hire additional people.
In Washington, President Bush used the jump in the unemployment rate to spur members of Congress to pass a ""robust"" tax-cut package to stimulate the economy. Speaking to defense workers in California, the president took the issue of the rising jobless rate, a potential political liability, and turned it to his advantage. The rising unemployment rate, he said, ""should serve as a clear signal to the United States Congress we need a bold economic recovery package so people can find work.""
Since the jobs report shows no sign of the postwar pickup that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has been predicting, it will probably make some already-pessimistic Fed officials even more convinced an immediate cut in interest rates is needed. However, Mr. Greenspan told Congress last week that only ""limited"" information is available on the economy's performance since war uncertainty began to lift, though he already knew the job market had weakened further in April. That suggests he will counsel patience at tomorrow's central-banking meeting, rather than advocate cutting short-term rates from their current, 42-year low of 1.25%."

It seems time, since over the past two weeks the markets have been giving off the symptoms of a stall. The stock market sidestepped into the new year and promptly fell about 250 points as of Friday's close. Markets reacted coldly last Tuesday to a 40-year bond offering by the government's S&L bailout agency. Gold began the year at about $400 and in three weeks is up to $420. Simultaneously, the White House has turned a bit cranky over the Fed's handling of monetary policy.
Most economists still expect merely a slowdown in growth, but the sense that something's wrong is palpable. What we've witnessed is entirely consistent with what we predicted in our two ""Mitchell Recession"" editorials in November. The market, and through it the general economy, is being whipsawed by Congress's handling of the capital-gains issue. We first noted back on November 7 that Senator Mitchell was congratulating himself for killing the Bush capital-gains proposal, and wondered whether he'd take credit later if the economy stalled. On November 30, with the market at 2688 we wrote:
""The stock market, after rising while a capital-gains cut gained political momentum, collapsed 190 points when Mr. Mitchell stopped it, and now remains at about the August 1 level. Everyone is therefore looking for the Fed to ease monetary policy.""
The market rallied a bit in December; tax advisers suggested that normal year-end profit-taking be pushed into 1990, because their consensus among people who mattered -- George Bush, Lloyd Bentsen, Dan Rostenkowski was that a capital-gains cut in 1990 was baked in the cake."

Why has it been difficult for the long bond to move down through 8 percent, and what will it take for long rates to fall to the low levels of 1987? The answers hinge on inflation and the recovery.
We have to go back to the first quarter of 1987 to find yields at those low levels, prior to the three recent instances. At that time, the bond traded at 7.27 percent to 7.88 percent, with the lower yields occurring in January 1987. Then, as the economy began to improve and inflation began to rise, rates rose until Oct. 19, 1987, when the Dow Jones industrial average fell 508 points.
Inflation is the first part of the answer. The consumer price index, a widely followed measure of inflation, rose a mere 1.1 percent from December 1985 to December 1986, helped by a 30.7 percent decline in energy costs. The CPI was up only 3.8 percent the previous year.
As a result of two good inflation years back to back, interest rates began to trend lower in February 1986, touching briefly at 7.16 percent in July, and then ambulating between 7.16 percent and 7.77 percent before closing the year at 7.33 percent. They plateaued in the first quarter of 1987."

842614819,incomes-in-u.s.-beat-inflation-during-'90s-boom,wsj_398807880,2002-06-05,"WASHINGTON -- The median U.S. household income rose almost 8% faster than inflation during the booming 1990s, reaching $41,994 by 1999, according to newly released census data.
The overall percentage of Americans living in poverty, however, fell only slightly to 12.4% from 13.1% in 1989, by the federal definition that set the income limit at $16,895 for a family of four in 1999. The percentage of Americans 65 and over with poverty status dropped to 9.9% from 12.8%.
The information, some of the most detailed yet from the 2000 Census, was compiled from long-form questionnaires that were given to roughly 17% of all U.S. households. They offer a glimpse into a variety of demographic trends, including the types of jobs people have, their education level, and how many cars they own.
Short-form data, released last year, pertain mostly to population counts, housing and race. The long-form data show, for instance, that homes where only English is spoken dropped to 82.1% from 86.2%, while the percentage of Americans with a bachelor's degree or higher rose to 24.4% from 20.3% a decade earlier.
The new income data show that poverty rates fell in parts of the South and the Midwest, though many rural areas continued to be some of the poorest communities, according to an analysis by the Associated Press. Without adjusting for inflation, the median income rose almost 40% from $30,056. The percentage of households earning more than $150,000 nearly tripled, to 4.6%."

The following questions and answers attempt to explain this troublesome phenomenon.
What is the credit crunch?
Simply put, it is the widespread reluctance of banks to lend to borrowers to whom they would have lent eagerly in the past. Because banks play a central role in financing economic growth, the credit crunch has broad effects on the U.S. economy. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan says it has ""very little historic precedent.""
What caused it?
With more and more loans going sour, the economy weakening and real estate values falling, bankers have grown more cautious. The memories of the excesses and financial failures of the 1980s are crimping lending in the 1990s. In addition, new rules, or capital standards, require many banks to either raise more capital from investors or make fewer loans. Unable or unwilling to raise capital, many banks are pulling back on lending."

In such an environment, the dollar often suffers. When that happens, strategists and money managers tend to counsel clients to favor shares of large companies. The idea is that because these companies tend to be multinationals that earn large chunks of revenue from operations outside the U.S., they are better positioned to weather weakness at home. Also, increased overseas interest rates support foreign currencies, making earnings abroad worth more when the income is ""repatriated"" into weaker dollars.
Trouble is, the recent track record for that advice isn't what it used to be.
""In the last 14 years, there's really been no advantage to moving to large-cap stocks"" during times of dollar weakness, said Mike Thompson, research director at Thomson Financial, referring to companies with the biggest stock-market values.
The research firm compared the performance of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, made up mostly of big multinationals, with various European currencies.

At the end of October, the Federal Reserve announced the first step in returning to a more normal monetary policy. After nearly six years of near-zero interest rates and quantitative easing, the Fed is ending its bond-buying program and has signaled a plan to eventually begin raising the federal-funds rate, raising interest rates to more normal levels by 2017.
U.S. households lost billions in interest income during the Fed's near-zero interest rate experiment. Because they are often reliant on income from savings, seniors were hit the hardest. Households headed by seniors 65-74 years old lost on average $1,900 in annual income over the past six years, according to a November 2013 McKinsey Global Institute report. For households headed by seniors 75 and older, the loss was $2,700 annually.
With a median income for senior households in the U.S. of roughly $25,000, these are significant losses. In total, according to my company's calculations, approximately $58 billion in annual income has been lost by America's seniors since 2008.
Retirees depend on income from their savings for basic living expenses. Without that income, many seniors have taken on greater risk to increase the potential yield on their savings, or simply spent down their nest eggs. After decades of playing by the rules, putting off spending and socking away money, seniors have taken it on the chin. This strikes a blow at the core American principles of self-reliance, individual responsibility and fairness.
Their lost income affects all Americans. Seniors make up 13% of the U.S. population and spend about $1.2 trillion annually -- a big chunk of America's $11.5 trillion consumer economy. In general, seniors spend more than their income, withdrawing each year from accumulated savings, and so their interest earnings get spent right back into the economy."

""Overall, the (GNP numbers) didn't have that much impact on the currency markets,"" John Baker, chief trader at Bank Julius Baer & Co., said.

The price deflator, an important indicator of inflation, rose at a 2.4% annual rate, slightly lower than the fourth quarter's 2.7%.
Some traders said the figures were mildly bullish for the dollar because they indicated a slight narrowing of the U.S. trade deficit and a slowing of non-farm inventory accumulation. On the other hand, some economists said the figures depicted a slower narrowing of the trade deficit than they expected. They said the apparent strength of consumer and business demand will make it difficult to slow imports.
Initially, the market seemed to view the figures bearishly, as the dollar fell to intraday lows of 1.6697 marks and 124.30 yen shortly after their release."

A sustained and significant rise in oil prices could derail the U.S. economic recovery by stirring inflation and putting the brakes on spending.
Oil futures touched $100 a barrel at the New York Mercantile Exchange Wednesday--the highest since before the financial crisis hit in late 2008--before pulling back. Pricier oil drives up the costs of everything from gas at the pump to the raw materials used to make nylon and food packaging. That could mean higher inflation and prompt consumers, who lately have shown more willingness to spend, to cut back their purchases.
Oil prices have risen 7.35% since the beginning of the year, while gasoline futures have risen 10.67%.
The question now is whether turmoil in the Middle East and Northern Africa could lead to a sustained cutback in production or delivery disruptions that could drive those prices much higher and push the U.S. as well as other countries back into recession. Supply-driven oil shocks, like the ones that came with the 1973 oil embargo and the 1979 Iranian revolution, were factors in past recessions."

Although battered by terrorism, war and economic uncertainty following the collapse of the Internet bubble, consumer spending has been a mainstay of the weak U.S. economy, fueled most recently by low interest rates that sparked a home-refinancing boom.

Their high-pressure tactics in promoting and passing legislation, most notably the economic ""stimulus"" enacted in February, have backfired. Those tactics include unbridled partisanship, procedural short cuts, demands for swift passage of bills, and promises of quick results.
With large majorities in Congress and an obsequious press corps, Mr. Obama was smitten with the idea of emulating President Franklin Roosevelt's First 100 Days of legislative success in 1933. Like FDR, Mr. Obama tried to push as many liberal bills through Congress in as brief a time as possible.
He made a rookie mistake early on. He let congressional Democrats draft the bills. They're as partisan as any group that has ever controlled Congress, and as impatient. They have little interest in the compromises needed to attract Republican support. As a consequence, what they passed -- especially the $787 billion stimulus -- belongs to Democrats alone. They own the stimulus outright.
That makes them accountable for the hopes of a prompt economic recovery now being dashed. With the economy still faltering and jobs still being lost, Mr. Obama's credibility is sinking and his job approval rating is declining along with the popularity of his initiatives.

Americans can take a moment to thank their friends in Europe when gassing up the SUV.

In two separate reports, the Commerce Department said new-home sales rose and businesses' orders for capital goods dropped in April. At first glance, that's at odds with the Fed's main scenario for what the economy will do this year: Consumer spending should slow as a weakening housing market makes people feel poorer, but increased business investment -- in the form of capital-goods purchases and hiring -- should help keep the deceleration from becoming a disaster.
Economists, however, warned against reading too much into the volatile monthly data, saying that longer-term trends still point toward slowing home sales and growing capital spending. ""We all agree that the housing market is cooling off, and some other sector of the economy must take the burden of keeping growth healthy,"" said Ethan Harris, chief U.S. economist at Lehman Brothers in New York. ""Capital spending is a prime candidate.""
New-home sales rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.19 million in April, up 4.9% from the previous month, thanks in part to a surge in Southern states. The number contrasted sharply with expectations of an April drop in home sales, but downward revisions to the previous months' numbers lessened the surprise. After revisions, the rate of new-home sales dropped 7.6% over the first three months of 2006, compared with a previous estimate of 4.2%. April's rate of sales was still 12.4% below the most recent peak in July 2005.

The number of weeks could be reduced, however, if the national unemployment rate, currently 7.5%, drops below 7% for two consecutive months.

One provision would require securities dealers to pay taxes on the year-end market value of their portfolios, rather than on the value at purchase. Another provision would bar new owners of failed thrifts from deducting losses for which the federal government has compensated them since March 4, 1991, a practice known as double-dipping.

It has executed the ""Cash for Clunkers"" program that boosted auto sales over the summer, and it has taken a wide range of steps to support the housing market.

From the Fed
Seem Inevitable
When Federal Reserve policy makers wrap up their meeting today, most of Wall Street is convinced that they will cut interest rates by at least a quarter of a point.
Before that happens, the Commerce Department will release its initial take on how the economy did in the third quarter. Economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires estimate gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 3.2%, down from the second quarter's 3.8%. The last time the economy grew at a better-than-3% rate for two quarters in a row was in 2004, when the Fed started raising rates. So why is the Fed, which cut its overnight target rate to 4.75% from 5.25% in September, lowering rates now?"

The proposed deal, under which Morgan Stanley would control two-thirds of the combined firm, dramatizes the global nature of finance today and the preeminence of U.S. firms, said Sam Hayes, a professor at the Harvard Business School and an expert on the investment banking industry.

WASHINGTON -- A barrage of sunny economic data poured in Wednesday, led by an upbeat regional report from the Federal Reserve's latest anecdotal survey of the economy.
The Federal Reserve's survey of business activity found that economic conditions were improving across the country and appear to be ""reasonably broadly based,"" with most areas noting growth in a number of industries.
Eleven of the 12 regional Fed districts reported faster growth, except the Atlanta district, which said the pace of economic growth was ""stable"" in October and early November. ""Labor markets across the nation generally improved or remained stable, with several districts noting a slowing in layoffs,"" the Fed said. Temporary workers are in increasing demand in the Boston, Minneapolis, Chicago and Richmond, Va., districts, the Fed said. But several districts reported that companies are waiting for sustained increases in orders before hiring permanent workers.
Also Wednesday, there were two upbeat reports on the U.S. manufacturing sector, which was the hardest-hit part of the economy during the 2001 recession. Orders for big-ticket items surged in October and a regional manufacturing index soared to a nine-year high in November. ""The factory sector is on fire,"" said Stephen Stanley, senior market economist at RBS Greenwich Capital."

NEW YORK -- Most Treasurys ended higher on a modest relief rally after the conclusion of two days of congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
But analysts viewed yesterday's relative calm as largely a pause after a sharp correction from oversold levels.
Last month, yields, which move inversely to prices, fell to historic lows after the Fed in early May cautioned about the risks of deflation. The market rallied strongly through mid-June, in part on speculation the Fed might use unconventional methods, such as buying longer-dated Treasurys, to ease monetary policy if the need arose.
But since late June, economists said, Fed officials seem to have tried to respond to what appeared to be a bubble-like appreciation in Treasurys. David Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley in New York, pointed to a statement by the Fed after a policy meeting in late June. ""We've certainly seen the lows in yield"" of this cycle, Mr. Greenlaw said, adding that the selloff in July has ""recorrected"" the Treasurys market back to where it was before deflation talk took hold."

This has lead some commentators and policy makers to speculate that there has been a fundamental change in the labor market. The view is that today's economy cannot support unemployment rates below 5%--like the levels that prevailed before the recession and in the late 1990s. Those in government may take some comfort in this view. It lowers expectations and provides a rationale for the dismal labor market.
Excuses aside, this issue is also important for central banks. The Federal Reserve and other central banks have some policy choices to make if the high rates of unemployment reflect cyclic phenomena. But if the problem is structural--perhaps reflecting a mismatch between skills needed by business and skills possessed by the unemployed--there is little the Fed can do.
Research I've done with James Spletzer of the U.S. Census Bureau shows that the problems in the labor market are not structural. They reflect slow economic growth, and the cure is a decent recovery.
In 2007, the unemployment rate was 4.4%. Two years later, it reached 10%. The structure of a modern economy does not change that quickly. The demographic composition of the labor force, its educational breakdown and even the industrial mix did not differ much between 2007 and 2009.
More specifically, from 2007 to 2009 unemployment grew dramatically in a few industries, and these changes contributed to the rise in overall unemployment. But the changes were similar to those experienced in prior recessions. As unemployment rates declined somewhat after 2009, the pattern played out in reverse. Industries that saw the largest increases in unemployment were the ones with the largest decreases as overall unemployment fell."

First-quarter revisions--down to 0.4% from 1.9%--reflected an economy at a near-standstill early in the year.

The economic lexicon is garbled with so many 'flations these days, it's getting a little hard to make sense of them all. During the 1970s, '80s and '90s, Washington policy makers waged a persistent battle against inflation, broadly defined as rising consumer prices. But for most of this year, as the inflation rate has fallen closer to zero, economists began to worry about the opposite trend -- the possibility that the U.S. could face Japan-style deflation, or falling consumer prices.
As we enter 2003, here comes a new watchword: reflation. The term refers to government efforts to pump up -- or reflate -- an economy that is stuck in a slump by flooding that economy with money. Essentially, reflation is the intentional effort by governments to ward off deflation by boosting demand and underpinning prices. Though it isn't quite the same as inflation, reflation can spark inflation problems if policy makers go too far.
The term is popping up often. In a recent report titled ""The Reflation Trade,"" Morgan Stanley Co. chief economist Stephen Roach argued that policy makers are now in a ""full-scale frontal assault on the perils of deflation."" That has made him more bullish on the stock market in the months ahead. James Grant, in his twice-monthly newsletter, Grant's Interest Rate Observer, writes about a ""global reflation program"" being led by the U.S. and spreading world-wide. That, he said, explains why prices for gold -- a hedge against inflation and his favorite investment -- are on the rise.
SOME ECONOMISTS who have been beating deflation drums are doing an about-face. ""There has been an important shift. The financial community is talking more about reflation . . . it is the thing to watch in 2003,"" says Paul McCulley, chief economist at Pacific Investment Management Co., the California bond-fund manager that recently advised clients that government-bond yields will rise as result of today's reflation tilt.
Behind the reflation focus is blunt talk by Federal Reserve officials. Earlier this month, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told economists in New York that while deflation is only a remote possibility, the central bank is ""extraordinarily sensitive"" to the potential perils associated with it and is prepared to forestall it if the economy moves further in that direction. In November, Fed governor Ben Bernanke laid out a series of unusual steps the Fed could take to get out of Japan-style deflation if it did happen -- such as lending more aggressively to banks to drive down private borrowing costs or buying foreign government bonds, which could weaken the dollar and boost exports."

A renewed plunge in long-term interest rates world-wide suggests the pessimists are winning.
Government bond yields in the U.S., the euro zone and Asia have all fallen sharply in recent weeks, fed by a diet of disappointing economic data, lackluster business investment and -- in a new development yesterday -- hopes that the Federal Reserve will soon take a break from raising interest rates.
The decline in long-term interest rates mystifies central bankers -- even Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan. They see creeping inflation risks and a still-robust outlook for the global economy outside of Europe. And they're increasingly concerned that low long-term rates are also fueling an unsustainable surge in housing prices.
Prices of 10-year Treasury bonds jumped yesterday and yields, which move in the opposite direction, tumbled to 3.89%, from 4% Tuesday. That's the lowest since March last year, before the first of the Fed's eight quarter-percentage-point interest-rate increases. The drop came after Richard Fisher, new president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said that the Fed is in the ""eighth inning"" of raising rates, suggesting he believed an increase by the Fed later this month might be its last. Investors expect the Fed to boost its target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, to 3.25% from 3% at its meeting on June 29 to June 30.
Mr. Fisher's comments are at odds with those of other Fed officials who have emphasized that interest rates are still too low to ensure low inflation. But his remarks reinforced a view of many bond traders and a few economists that economic growth in the U.S. is slowing and inflation is ebbing, both of which will lead the Fed to take a pause from raising rates."

""I don't think the Texas economy is going to improve a lot in the near term,"" he said, although ""the psychology is so much better.""
Some analysts say the run-up in oil prices actually could prove detrimental to energy-state economies and therefore to banks in the region. Since the last boom-bust cycle in the oil industry, many of those economies have diversified into industries more closely linked to the general U.S. economy. Thus, the reasoning goes, if higher energy costs cause a recession in the rest of the U.S., states such as Texas would suffer too.
According to Sandra J. Flannigan, an analyst with Alex. Brown & Sons Inc., Baltimore, oil and gas accounted for only 15% of Texas's economic output in 1989, compared with a peak of 27% in 1981.
Energy companies, worried that prices could sink again as fast as they rose, are being much more cautious about new investments and exploration this time.

Last month's gap compared with a revised $11.12 billion deficit in December. Originally, the December figure was estimated at $12.08 billion.
January's deficit was the narrowest since $1.01 billion last June, Treasury data show. The Treasury said federal government receipts totaled $81.77 billion in January, compared with $76.70 billion a year earlier. Outlays were $83.94 billion last month, compared with $83.19 billion the year before.
George Gould, Treasury undersecretary for finance, told a group of business economists here that during the first four months of fiscal 1987, revenues were $8 billion to $9 billion higher than the amount the Treasury had anticipated. He attributed this in part to tax law changes, including the phasing out of many deductions, that apparently have caused individuals and businesses to increase payments of estimated taxes.

In a speech to a group of business executives, Mr. Greenspan said recent interest rate increases in the financial markets reflect fears of a pickup in inflation, conceding that there is ""an implicit rise in the inflation rate embodied in long-term (interest) rates."" But he restated his view that the markets are expecting something that is in the ""lower probabilities"" of the likely outcomes.
The Fed chief said that signs of shortages that would lead to a pickup in inflation are likely to show up first in a lengthening of the delivery times for raw materials. Such delays aren't showing up across the board, he said, indicating that the economy isn't ""approaching full capacity.""
He said that a recent ""dramatic rise in steel scrap prices"" and higher prices for other commodities reflect increased demand as the basic industrial sector of the economy revives, rather than an acceleration in inflation.
Mr. Greenspan said this revival has been due partly to an ""extraordinary shift currently under way"" in the nation's trade balance, as exports rise and domestic producers gain an increasing share of the U.S. market. He conceded that the turnaround still hasn't shown up in the nominal trade figures, as higher import prices continue to push up the dollar value of the nation's import bill."

Despite this slight rise, however, the construction rate was a further indication that the board probably will remove most credit restrictions from home buying in the fall. A new law says housing credit restrictions should be drastically relaxed when housing starts pver a three month period do not better an annual rate of two million units.

Despite steady drops in consumer confidence since the start of the year, consumers are borrowing again. Consumer installment credit has been rising at a fairly strong clip since December, in fact, its fastest growth rate since 1989.
Yesterday, the Federal Reserve said the debt loads of Americans fell in May by $802 million, or at an annual rate of 1.3%, but the central bank blamed the drop on a statistical quirk. The Fed said the decline came about when $3 billion of loans were sold to groups outside the scope of its survey. If these loans had been counted in the survey, the report would have shown the tenth increase in a row.
Auto loans in May rose a healthy $1.73 billion, or 7.9% at an annual rate, while credit-card debt and other revolving credit were up $942 million, or an annual rate of 4.3%.

Our heavy dependence on capital from foreign investors to finance both the federal budget deficit and the current account deficit (of which the trade deficit is the largest component) were the underlying factors.
The international investor considers opportunity costs in evaluating investment prospects in terms of the premium on U.S. rates over domestic rates. Consequently, faced with larger investment risks in dollar-denominated securities, foreign investors demanded larger-than-usual yields to entice them into owning U.S. bonds.
In the United States, the main problems were what to do about the dollarâ€”whether to defend it or allow it to move lower in hopes of reversing the trade deficitâ€”and how to attract foreign capital in order to finance the trade and budget deficits.
Initially, the Treasuryâ€™s dollar policy was anchored in the Louvre Accord, in which the Group of Seven industrialized nationsâ€”the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italyâ€”agreed to support the dollar while the United States made efforts to reduce the budget deficit."

Yet even by post-bubble standards, the period stood out for its painful mood swings. It began with near panic about the state of corporate governance and the quality of U.S. earnings. These concerns pounded stock prices globally, climaxing with new lows for the bear market near the end of July. A sharp rally followed and many investors predicted that the long-awaited bottom had at last arrived.

But even before the trade report, Lawrence J. Greenberg, an economist at Chemical Bank, New York, had figured that a late-December sell-off was all but inevitable.
In fact, Mr. Greenberg has predicted a late-December dollar decline for every year since 1981. In all but one period, his predictions proved right.
The 40-year-old former Federal Reserve economist doesn't use a crystal ball. His annual year-end forecast is based on the dollar's historic trading pattern in Decembers. In 13 of the past 14 years, the dollar has fallen in value between mid-December and New Year's Day, and has failed to do so only twice since the start of the modern floating exchange system in the early 1970s.
A nine-year veteran in Chemical's foreign exchange advisory service, Mr. Greenberg normally relies exclusively on fundamental economic factors in forecasting currency trends. But six years ago, with a shortage of any major factors in the typically dull holiday season, he recalled a series of end-of-the-year declines and saw a connection.
""I'm struck by the consistency of it,"" he says of the trend. ""You're not going to get that by flipping a coin."" He suggests that the dollar's performance in no other two-week period would reveal such a predictable showing over so many years."

Interviews with Fed governors and district presidents who make up the central bank's policy committee suggest that many of them believe higher interest rates are needed to cool down the economy and prevent an acceleration of inflation.
The 463,000-job increase in payroll employment ""was far bigger than anyone thought it was going to be,"" said Robert Black, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. The latest numbers add to ""anecdotal information from our district that the economy continues to be robust,"" agrees Cleveland Fed President Lee Hoskins. ""There is some sign here that policy should continue to err on the side of containing inflation.""
But the Fed is unlikely to take decisive action before the Dec. 14 meeting unless it is confronted with a steep decline in the dollar. That's because officials are reluctant to appear overly responsive to monthly employment figures. ""Taking one month's figures and reacting in a knee-jerk manner is inappropriate for policymakers,"" says Roger Guffey, president of the Kansas City Fed, expressing a view that was echoed by other Fed officials.
The presidents of the 12 Fed district banks have been leading the charge this year for a tighter monetary policy. The employment figures out Friday clearly reinforced their hawkish views.

As Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen declared unequivocally for the first time that the dollar has fallen too far, the U.S. recruited allies ranging from Germany to Portugal to buy dollars in the most-coordinated show of force that currency markets have seen in a decade.
The intervention met with modest initial success, but the markets are sure to test the dollar again. And this will increase pressure on the Federal Reserve Board to further increase interest rates to shore up the currency. The dollar traded late yesterday at 1.6535 marks, up from 1.6368 the day before, and at 101.85 yen, up from 101.00.
In a clear and deliberate departure from past rhetoric, which described intervention as a response to ""disorderly"" markets and ""volatility,"" Mr. Bentsen said yesterday's moves ""reflect our view that recent movements in exchange markets have gone beyond what is justified by economic fundamentals."" Trying to dispel the notion that the U.S. wants to depreciate its currency to make its exports more attractive and to put pressure on Japan to agree to trade concessions, Mr. Bentsen said: ""This administration sees no advantage in an undervalued currency.""
Administration officials say that the markets have badly misread their dollar policy. The intervention is an effort to ""counteract a negative psychology that had developed in part on the false perception that the U.S. was trying to drive down the dollar for competitive reasons or that the U.S. was somehow indifferent to where market forces took the dollar,"" a senior Treasury official said yesterday. Of course, Mr. Bentsen himself contributed to all this back in February 1993, just after taking office, when he told a questioner that he would like to see a stronger yen. He has since been more careful, but other officials occasionally have reinforced the markets' impression that the administration favors a weak dollar. That view gained credence earlier this year when the Treasury failed to act to brake the dollar when it fell sharply against the yen."

Yesterday's turmoil came partly in response to some bond and financial futures markets trading based on rumored leaks of information that the Commerce Department's retail sales report would show a 2.5% increase for August and that the Labor Department's producer price index for August would register a 0.5% rise. If true, the figures, particularly the retail sales number, would suggest that the economy is growing more briskly than many forecasters expected.
Traders pay close attention to these economic reports, and when they differ from what was expected it can lead to turmoil in the market.
While leak rumors aren't unusual, their pace seems to have stepped up in the wake of two recent instances when rumors proved to be on target. Traders, asserting they had received leaked figures, accurately predicted last month that the Commerce Department's revised figures for second-quarter gross national product would show a 0.6% rise at an inflation-adjusted annual rate and that the agency's index of leading indicators would jump 1.1% for July.

There is, he said, ""little evidence that the American economy . . . is slowing appreciably.""
In a booklet presented to the House Banking Committee accompanying Mr. Greenspan's testimony, Fed staffers wrote that the continued surge in demand ""implies that the level of interest rates needed to align demand with potential supply may have increased substantially.""

Are there costs associated with refinancing? Is there a formula that tells us whether refinancing makes sense?
A In recent years, many homeowners have made refinancing almost an annual ritual. Interest rates, which are near an all-time low, have been steadily dropping, and consumers have taken advantage of these lower rates.
There are some costs, though, just as there were when you obtained your original mortgage. The only differences between a purchase and a refinance are that there is no buyer or seller present at closing, and no real estate broker is involved.
Your refinance lender, even if it is the same lender who holds your current loan, has to start from scratch. The lender must obtain current financial information about you, contract for an updated appraisal of the property and receive an updated title report. Just because everything was acceptable several years ago when you obtained your mortgage does not mean that everything is acceptable today.
You should shop around. Contact several mortgage lenders and brokers to determine what interest rates you can obtain. Determine what the various rates will be for a fixed 30-year mortgage, and compare those rates with a fixed 15-year mortgage as well as with an adjustable-rate mortgage."

David Robertson, president of the Nilson Report, a newsletter that monitors the credit card industry, said he thinks the new cards could be attractive to consumers fed up with punitive fees.

Earlier in the year Mr. Sohn, economist and chief executive of Hanmi Financial Corp. in Los Angeles, was visiting a California jeans producer whose executives told him they couldn't keep up with demand for high-priced clothing. He figured ""there must be money out there if people are willing to pay that much"" for bluejeans. The insight -- along with reports from other clients that costs were rising -- led Mr. Sohn, 61 years old, to increase his 2005 projection for inflation and to stick with his call for healthy economic growth in the U.S.
The resulting prediction of growth of about 3.8% for the first three quarters and above-trend inflation of about 3.6% left him ahead of the pack when the results were tabulated. U.S. gross domestic product expanded, on average, at a 3.7% annual rate during the first nine months, and, as of November, the consumer-price index was up 3.5% from a year earlier. Most other economists had forecast lower inflation and a little less growth in 2005. (Preliminary estimates of fourth-quarter growth are slated for later in January.)
Also among the most accurate were J. Dewey Daane, a retired professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee; Mickey Levy, chief economist at Bank of America in New York; Gail Fosler, chief economist with the Conference Board in New York; and Maria Fiorini Ramirez of MFR Inc., an economic-consulting firm in New York. All five had above-average inflation forecasts, and three of the five had above-average growth forecasts.
Many forecasters rely on econometric models to come up with forecasts for economic growth, inflation, interest rates and exchange rates. Mr. Sohn finds a little intuition comes in handy, too. ""I talk to people on the ground,"" he says."

After the recent attention to the increases in oil prices, and their contribution to the probability of a recession, itâ€™s useful to take a look at the prices of another basic commodity, steel. OPEC has held oil prices steady this year but, as you doubtless saw, intends to raise them 14.5 percent in the coming year. By an instructive coincidence, 14.5 percent is just about the average increase in steel prices over the past year, and there is more to come in January.
This disproportionately fast run-up in steel prices is the resultâ€”unintentional, but realâ€”of the Carter administrationâ€™s attempts to protect the U.S. steel industry from its foreign competitors. The American producers had been complaining that the foreign mills were selling steel here below cost, to avoid unemployment at home. That's called dumping, and itâ€™s illegal. Just about a year ago, the Treasury Department announced its trigger price system. It calculated the real cost of making steel in the most efficient millsâ€”Japanâ€™sâ€”and any steel imported below that price was to trigger ail immediate dumping investigation. It was an ingenious idea. Unfortunately, it did not foresee the drastic rise in the value of the Japanese yen throughout 1978.
As the yen soared, it took the trigger prices up \v ith it. Knowing that their foreign competitors would not come into this country below the trigger price, the American companies raised their own prices right along with the triggers. The trigger system became, in a manner of speaking, price controls in reverse. Instead of a ceiling holding prices down, for the American producers it provided a floor under pricesâ€”and, as in an elevator, the floor was rising. The whole trigger experiment has become another painful example of the truth that protectionism is highly inflationary.
reaction to the closing of steel mills in Ohioâ€™s Mahoning Valley, around Youngstown. The closings were blamed on the imports, and the first reports indicated vast unemployment and unbearable hardship for whole communities. But time has passed, and it has become obvious that the social impact of the closings was greatly overestimated. The current unemployment rate there is less than one percentage point higher than the national average. While the inflationary costs of the trigger prices have swollen far beyond any expectation, the social distress caused by the shutdowns of those obsolescent mills in Ohio turns out to have been, happily, much more shortlived than anyone could have hoped a year ago.
What comes next? On Jan. 1, OPEC imposes a 5 percent increase. Itâ€™s the first of four increments scheduled for 1979. On the same day, the Treasury has announced, the steel trigger prices will go up another 7 percent under the automatic formula. The industry has already indicated that it will follow with price increases in the range of 3.5 percent. While the causes of these rises in oil and steel prices are different, the effects will be remarkably similar."
842616830,board-of-contributors:-goose-the-money-supply,wsj_395223514,1992-02-03,"When Alan Greenspan appears before the Senate and House Banking Committees later this month, a primary focus of his testimony will be the Fed's target for money supply growth during the current year. The decision on that rate of increase will be made during the next two days by the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee.
There's a good reason that the Federal Reserve is required to report on its target for the growth of the money supply rather than its target for interest rates. The change in the growth of the money supply is a good indicator of where the economy is likely to be headed in the near future. While it is certainly not a perfect indicator, the increase in the broad M2 monetary aggregate (that includes small time deposits and money market mutual funds as well as checking account deposits and currency) is far better than interest rates as a guide to the future growth of total spending in the economy.
As a rough rule of thumb, experience shows that the rate of growth of total nominal gross domestic product is approximately equal to the rate of increase of M2 six months earlier. Although there have been variations in this relation from year to year, over the past two decades nominal GDP has grown at an annual rate of 8.5% while the stock of M2 has grown by 8.7%. Recent experience also conforms quite closely to this general rule: Total nominal GDP rose 3.2% from the fourth quarter of 1990 until the fourth quarter of 1991, while M2 increased by 3.3% from the second quarter of 1990 to the second quarter of 1991.
The slow growth of nominal GDP last year helped to bring down inflation. But even with only a 3% percent rise of the GDP price deflator during 1991, the 3.2% nominal GDP rise left room for real GDP growth of only 0.2% from the fourth quarter of 1990 until the fourth quarter of 1991. A decline of GDP in the first quarter of 1991 was followed by a resumption of growth in the second and third quarters but then a fourth quarter in which real GDP rose only 0.3%. For the year as a whole, real GDP in 1991 was nearly 1% lower than in 1990. This recent slowdown would probably have been avoided if the Federal Reserve had provided faster growth of M2 earlier in the year.
Looking ahead, the level of economic activity during the first half of 1992 is likely to show very little if any increase because of the very slow growth of the money supply in the second half of 1991. Since M2 grew at an annual rate of only 1.3% from the second quarter of 1991 until the final quarter of the year, the rule of thumb based on past experience implies that nominal GDP will also rise only 1.3% during the first half of 1992. Unless the inflation rate drops below 1.3%, that simple forecasting rule implies no real growth in the first half of 1992."

As Washington debates the fate of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, many lawmakers have fallen into a logical trap of their own making. Although they recognize that tax increases hurt the economy, they argue that our huge deficit requires Congress to raise revenue through a tax hike.
This argument rests on the flawed premise that we can reduce the deficit only by increasing taxes, as if high levels of spending are a given. Not so.
To reduce spending and reignite growth, this Congress or its successor should take two actions. First, immediately cut the level of spending that has been increased so dramatically since 2008. Second, institute an ""inflation-minus-one"" rule to constrain future spending increases.
Much public discussion focuses on the deficit, which is indeed at critical levels of around 10% of GDP. But even if President Obama succeeds at lowering the deficit to 4% of GDP by 2013, our public-debt-to-GDP ratio will still be dangerously high, at over 70%, or nearly twice what it was during the Bush years. As the economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff have shown in the journal American Economic Review, such high debt-to-GDP ratios are associated with low growth."

A series of large regional banks reported Tuesday that rising losses from bad loans plagued first-quarter results. That is forcing major institutions such as U.S. Bancorp and Regions Financial Corp. to put more money aside to fortify against more defaults.
The results showed how widespread the damage is as banks of all sizes pay a steep price for extending credit to shaky borrowers when times were good. Banks throughout the U.S. are feeling the pain, telling investors that a protracted recession means the situation will get worse before it gets better.
""No significant turnaround will occur this year,"" said Huntington Bancshares Inc. Chief Executive Stephen Steinour after the Columbus, Ohio, bank posted a $2.43 billion quarterly loss, or $6.79 a share, compared with year-earlier profit of $127.1 million, or 35 cents a share. Huntington took a nearly $300 million credit-loss provision as it faces potential losses from commercial loans.
The tight credit environment makes it more difficult for consumer and business borrowers to pay their debts. Falling stock markets and rising unemployment also demonstrate the depth of the economic stress, regional bank CEOs said."

Despite lackluster performances there in his previous two bids, Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. is betting that anxiety about the faltering economic recovery and discontent with the status quo will penetrate even a left-leaning jurisdiction that is home to more federal workers than any other in the state.
Ehrlich, who plans to campaign again in Montgomery on Tuesday, has mapped a strategy that in part seeks to win votes in the western and northern parts of the county, which are more conservative than the communities that hug the Capital Beltway. He hopes a message of lower taxes and a friendlier business climate will sell in a county that has an increasingly diversified private sector.
""This is the type of election cycle where Democrats are more willing to cross party lines,"" Ehrlich said as he took a break recently from greeting seniors arriving at the county fair in Gaithersburg. ""We think the low 40s is doable here.""

The federal budget today consumes more than 24% of economic output, a one-third increase since 2001 in the share of the U.S. economy allocated by politics rather than market forces. That makes the Republican House budget, which would reverse this trend, extremely important for the economic health of the country.
Both political parties deserve blame for the spending spree that's put America in a fiscal ditch. President George W. Bush was a big spender and President Obama has compounded the damage with his stimulus spending and other programs.
But the era of bipartisan big government may have come to an end. Largely thanks to Rep. Paul Ryan and the fiscal blueprint he prepared as chairman of the House Budget Committee earlier this year, the GOP has begun climbing back on the wagon of fiscal sobriety and has shown at least some willingness to restrain the growth of government.
The Ryan budget has generated considerable controversy in Washington, and it will become even more of an issue now that Mr. Ryan is Mitt Romney's running mate. So it's an appropriate time to analyze the plan and consider what it would mean for America.
The most important headline about the Ryan budget is that it limits the growth rate of federal spending, with outlays increasing by an average of 3.1% annually over the next 10 years. If spending is left on autopilot, by contrast, it would grow by 4.3% (or nearly 39% faster). If President Obama is re-elected, the burden of spending presumably will climb more rapidly."

McCain suggests that ""the choice is between the right change and the wrong change."" If it's the war that is the focus of all this talk about change, well, that's understandable, and maybe people really do want change. But if it's the economy, it's hard to imagine that change could happen any faster.
In fact, the U.S. economy (really, the global economy) is transforming at an absolutely astounding rate. We're living in Internet Time, where policies and their consequences travel the world at the speed of light. The normal human reaction to such a rapid pace of change is to be overwhelmed, stressed out, anxious and fearful. As a result, it is probably true that when voters listen to talk about change, what they really hear are promises of ""no change,"" which would be a huge difference from the status quo.

Your grandfather and father may have worked for General Motors (and joined the UAW), but it's likely that you don't and won't.
The problem, if it really is one, is not foreign competition or evil financiers. It is technology and productivity. In the 10 years ending in 2007, durable goods manufacturing productivity averaged an annual growth rate of 4.8%.

Who could possibly have imagined a year ago that overall business activity -- notwithstanding an unprecedented crash in the stock market -- would remain briskly on the rise in mid-1988? Who could have guessed that the expansion would be rolling relentlessly through a sixth straight year, with no end in sight?
Economists who failed to anticipate this durability may be tempted to despair, sensing that imponderables so overhang the business scene nowadays that forecasting has grown too hazardous an occupation. Indeed, they may be moved to seek safer work, like wrestling with alligators instead of numbers.
Before anyone sets out for the Everglades, however, it may be worth taking a retrospective look at the economy's recent behavior, for it's not as perplexing as one might suppose from all the tarnished forecasting records.
Expansion phases of the business cycle normally end only after a rising economy begins to bump against constraints to further growth. These constraints may be physical, as when labor or productive capacity proves insufficient to meet demand, or they may be financial, as when credit is too costly or simply unavailable.
This basic characteristic of the business cycle tended to be overlooked in the widespread concern last year, particularly after the October market crash, that a recession would soon set in, possibly by the start of 1988."

The venture-capital firm had invested in such companies as online travel site cFares Inc. and genetic-technology start-up Gene Security Network Inc., with cash from a $130 million venture fund it launched in 2005.
Amid the financial crisis and the plunging stock market, Claremont Creek decided to focus on the fund's best investments and stop backing the less-promising start-ups. It wanted to be sure it had enough cash for the next few years for the winners. The venture firm ranked the start-ups in the fund's 16-company portfolio with an A, B or C grade.
""We're doubling down on the As and likely won't invest any more capital in the C companies,"" says John Steuart, a Claremont Creek managing director. ""The portfolio is competing against itself and it's survival of the fittest. It's brutal.""

These ""may not be high-flyers, but they get you back into the equity market without a lot of risk,"" says Lawrence Kantor, executive vice president at Lexington Management Co. in Saddle Brook, N.J.
Minimizing risk has a high priority for individual investors since the October 1987 market crash, which left many with a distaste for stocks. Millions poured cash into safer money-market funds, where yields sometimes exceed 10%, or Treasury bills, which now yield 8 1/2% or more.
But recently money managers have noticed an increasing appetite among small investors for stock funds managed with a conservative strategy, especially those that invest in old-line, blue-chip companies that pay hefty dividends. The appeal of such funds suggests that small investors want to play the stock market -- but want a cushion in case a recession develops.
T. Rowe Price Associates' Equity Income Fund, the firm's most conservative stock fund, expanded its assets 70% this year to $850 million from $500 million. Its total return, price gains plus dividends, advanced 22% in the 12 months through May 4; it has risen 8.5% so far this year."

The U.S. consumer-price index was unchanged in September, the Labor Department said Thursday, after falling in August for the first time in almost two years. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so- called core consumer prices -- which are believed to give a more stable reading of inflation -- advanced just 0.1% last month. And the year-over-year rate of inflation, at 4.9%, is coming down from high levels reached this summer.
There was widespread softness in pricing. Transportation prices fell 0.6% as airline fares and new-car prices dropped. Housing, which accounts for 40% of the consumer-price index, fell 0.1% for a second straight month, the first back-to-back declines since 2001. Clothing prices fell 0.1% for the month.
Other signs of economic weakness are building, including a report by the Fed on Thursday that U.S. industrial production dropped sharply in September.
The inflation readings underscore a growing belief inside the Fed that inflation pressures are easing, as many senior officials expected earlier this year. Indeed, financial shocks like the one the U.S. is experiencing could eventually lead to the opposite of inflation -- deflation, or a broad decline in prices -- though that doesn't look like a serious risk, given the amount of stimulus going into the U.S. economy."
830983923,the-case-for-a-recession,wapo_307120574,1989-04-12,"Economist Bill Helming runs a small consulting service in Shawnee Mission, Kans. His clients include major food companies, banks, supermarket chains, feed-lot operators and farmers. Of 80 economists surveyed recently by the Blue Chip Economic Indicators-a newsletter that follows economic forecasts-Helming is the gloomiest. He's predicting recession. In 1990, unemployment would average 6.5 percent, up from March's 5 percent. And the economy's output of goods and services (gross national product) would drop 1.5 percent.
What this country could use is a modest recession to reverse rising inflation. Chances are you won't read that elsewhere. In polite society, almost no one admits that recessions are inevitable and sometimes desirable. What's unmentionable, though, happens to be true. Outside of wartime-when people may tolerate wage and price controls-periodic recessions have been the only practical way of containing inflation. It's a truth worth remembering as the 1980s' economic expansion (now in its seventh year) enters its final stages.
There are multiplying signs of strains. By every indicator (consumer prices, producer prices and labor costs), inflation is increasing. Since last spring the Federal Reserve has raised short-term interest rates more than 3 percentage points. Although unemployment remains low, some of the zip is going out of the economy. Auto sales are dropping. Home buying is declining and increases in retail sales have been small. But the Fed does not say for a moment that it's trying to engineer a recession, and few private economists dare predict one.
Analysts like Helming are the exceptions. The typical forecaster anticipates a relatively harmless slowdown. Of the forecasts regularly followed by the ""blue chip"" newsletter, the average calls for economic growth (the increase in GNP) of 2.7 percent in 1989 and 1.7 percent in 1990, compared with 3.9 percent in 1988. This is what the Fed says it wants: in the""What this country could use is a modest recession to reverse rising inflation."" current jargon, a ""soft landing"" that will somehow disarm inflation.
On paper, the strategy could work. In practice, the odds are against it. The process by which inflation relents is no great mystery. Higher unemployment relieves pressures for steeper wage increases. Excess inventories, idle factory capacity and ample supplies of commodities (such as grains, metals and chemicals) weaken price pressures. If slower growth doesn't produce these conditions, inflation almost certainly won't abate. It could get worse. That's the danger, because both consumer prices and labor costs are already advancing at a rate of about 5 percent annually."
842616754,the-market's-frame-of-mind,wsj_398869906,2004-03-30,"To the market's surprise the most recent Federal Open Market Committee statement didn't even hint at the threats implicit in the rise in commodity prices, especially oil, or the dollar's fall. These events have lowered the threat of deflation to virtually zero, but the Fed insists that deflation is still a slightly higher risk than inflation. Is the Fed keeping its head in the sand? Is Alan Greenspan bowing to George Bush and the upcoming election? Even before the Fed meeting, an increasing number of commentators insisted the Fed is too easy. Now such criticism has reached a crescendo.
On the surface, the censure seems justified. Commodity prices are rapidly increasing; the Commodity Research Bureau index of actively traded commodities is now at a level not seen since the inflation bubble of 1980. Oil stays stubbornly high, near $40 per barrel, and the Journal of Commerce Index of lightly processed commodities, once a favorite Greenspan indicator, has soared to an all-time high. And although the dollar has stabilized, it is down 25% against a basket of currencies since early 2002. Finally, the real Fed funds rate has been negative for two years and relative to real economic growth, the most negative since the inflationary '70s.
But there are good responses to these points. The rising commodity prices are due to China, which is churning out lower priced goods that keep inflation in check. The dollar has indeed dropped, but two years ago economists were saying it was too high. Today it's at, or just below, its purchasing power parity level, consistent with the persistent current account deficit. Furthermore, the smart money in the oil futures market says that the price is coming down sharply. And there is also a good response to the low real rates, a key variable in the critics' argument. Inflation hawks have maintained that by keeping the after-inflation cost of money negative, the Fed is feeding the fires of future inflation.
But if monetary policy were really too accommodating, wouldn't we see rising interest rates in the bond market? Yet with the 10-year bond yield under 4%, we see no such concern. Are those calling for higher rates saying that the bond vigilantes -- who have kept government and the Fed honest by pushing bond prices lower when the Fed's action has been inflationary -- are flat out wrong? That would be a sharp reversal from the past when the bond market was routinely praised for warning errant governments of monetary and fiscal profligacy.
With the 10-year indexed bond yielding a record-low 1.4%, a zero or even negative real Fed funds rate -- what we have now -- looks about right. If the Fed raised short-term rates, it would risk flattening or inverting the yield curve, something very dangerous early in a recovery."

Part of the problem, strategists from both parties acknowledge, is that economic issues simply don't stir voter passions when times are so good: when inflation is subdued, the jobless rate has fallen to a three-decade low and the stock market remains buoyant. Indeed, many economic policy entrepreneurs say they are writing off the next two years and instead are concentrating on ideas that will resonate in the 2000 presidential campaign.
Equally vexing, however, is that policy proposals being debated in both political camps seem as likely to highlight intra-party differences as to draw clear distinctions between Republicans and Democrats.
White House economic advisers, reflecting President Clinton's interest in securing his legacy, are pondering long-term challenges -- how to boost productivity through improvements in education, for example, or how to ensure lasting solvency for federal entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security. ""It's one of those rare moments when you have a chance to step back and reflect on your fundamental priorities,"" said Gene Sperling, chairman of Clinton's National Economic Council.

So ominous is the rise that the president of the National Safety Council, Howard Pyle, warned of â€œtotals of tragedy far beyond anything in automotive history.â€ù This will help the push for a strong Federal safety standards bill. Whether the responsibility lies with the states or with the Federal Government is one of the bones of contention.

Average hourly pay of blue-collar and clerical workers is slightly lower in purchasing power now than it was in 1973 and has made no progress even in the prosperous mid-1980s. Counting managers, professionals, other self-employed people, and the rising share of employee compensation received as fringe benefits, real earnings per hour have increased only 0.7% a year from 1973 through 1987.
Income per capita has risen faster than income per hour because a larger share of the adult population is working more hours per capita. In other words, we are working harder for it, and this has its cost in leisure, child care, and home-cooked meals. Per-capita income also rose faster than hourly pay because of the faster rise in interest income and Social Security.
The reasons for stagnant real wages will be much debated in this election year. But this epoch may now be ending, regardless of who becomes the next president.
The world's postwar economic boom foundered in the 1970s just when the U.S. labor force was growing at a pace unmatched since early in the century. Pay fell behind oil-fueled price rises partly because plentiful young workers were a drag on productivity. Young and other marginal workers, including swelling ranks of low-income single mothers, lost ground rapidly relative to others in the general retrenchment in the 1980s.
Intense foreign competition, due mainly to exchange-rate maladjustments, held down wages (as well as prices and profits) in the mid-1980s in all industries exposed to international competition. Some of the lag in average wages stemmed from erosion of union wage scales that were out of line with the rest of the economy. Union wages in manufacturing, construction and transportation have been undermined by spreading nonunion competition. Federal deregulation of the airline and trucking industries accelerated the breakdown of their sheltered wage and price structures by allowing new competition in markets that for decades had been protected."

Treasury and congressional analysts caution that it's too soon to tell whether the surge will mean a smaller deficit for the year; the high April payments could be offset by low receipts later.

A lack of progress in reducing the U.S. budget deficit also could diminish foreigners' confidence in the U.S. and its currency.
Last year, the dollar surprised many analysts. Expectations at the start of the year were that the U.S. currency would fall sharply, continuing a decline that began in late February 1985.

Investors have been hearing about inflation a lot lately, and they heard still more Friday. The Labor Department said the consumer price index, a closely watched barometer of inflation, rose 0.4% in March, or at a compound annual rate of 5.1%. Last year, the consumer price index rose just 1.1%.
Friday's report only confirmed the accelerating inflation some stock market investors were anticipating a while ago when they jumped into gold stocks, traditional hedges against inflation. But those investors also bid up the average price-earnings ratio of North American gold issues above 50. So, investors who cower at the thought of rising inflation will have to pay dearly if they take refuge in gold.
Although some analysts aren't sure the gold stocks are a particularly smart anti-inflation bet at their current prices, the analysts are also uncertain about where else investors can find a haven from inflation.

North Sea Brent crude on London's ICE futures exchange shed 88 cents, or 1.2%, to $73.82.
The euro weakened to $1.2324 against the dollar from $1.2370 before the Fitch downgrade was announced. A stronger dollar puts pressure on oil prices, as it makes oil more expensive for holders of other currencies and could thus crimp demand.
Oil's decline demonstrates how the energy markets remain sensitive to swings in the currency markets caused by Europe's debt problems. Signs of stabilization in Europe and strong economic data from the U.S. and China helped crude stage a strong recovery this week from a sell-off that had brought prices to as low as $64.24 a barrel.
On Thursday, oil prices posted the strongest advance of the year, rising $3.04 a barrel, or 4.3%, as Spain agreed to budget cuts and China reiterated its commitment to European bond investments. Stock markets and other commodities posted sharp price increases as investors regained an appetite for risk following a three-week sell-off sparked by concerns over Europe's debt situation and the pace of economic recovery in the U.S. and China.

This latest evidence that the economy is surging ahead pushed up short-term interest rates yesterday. Investors and traders said they expect the Federal Reserve might seek to cool off the economy by providing less cash to the banking system, a move that would boost key overnight interest rates again. The Fed raised its target for overnight rates earlier this month by three-fourths of a percentage point, the sixth increase this year.
However, some analysts said the Fed likely would leave rates unchanged for the next two months as its policy makers wait to see whether this year's rate increases begin to slow economic growth. The central bank favors slower growth in the hope it will curb inflation.

While the overall CPI registered the biggest monthly jump in 31/2 years, rising 0.6%, the more closely watched core index, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, edged up 0.2%. Expectations were for a 0.5% gain in the headline number, with a 0.2% rise in core prices.

Thus, Mr. Greenspan said, he still expects to be able to lift interest rates at a ""measured"" pace this year, though he reaffirmed that the Fed is prepared to raise rates more aggressively if necessary."

Overall, 10 of the districts, in their report for November, noted slight to moderate gains in some or all sectors of the economy. Retailers in particular said activity had picked up in October and early November, and many were optimistic about the current holiday season. The Chicago district went so far as to call it ""the best performance in eight years.""
Badly battered consumer confidence also seemed to be on the mend in many areas, a trend that respondents in Boston and Chicago linked to the end of the presidential election campaign. In New York, however, retailers attributed the somewhat brighter picture to promotional efforts rather than to any meaningful revival in the economy.
Manufacturers in about half of the Fed districts said things are looking up, albeit generally quite modestly. Ongoing cutbacks in the defense industry remain a drag on the recovery in some regions. And while indicators from Dallas are strong, and Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland and Chicago reported small gains, many industrial concerns in the New York district and California continue to experience weak demand.
Construction and real estate remain ""a tale of two markets,"" the report said, with improvements in the residential sector and continued stagnation on the commercial side. In Southern California, for example, some commercial rents have fallen 25% to 40%, and forecasts for next year show rents tumbling an additional 10% or more; the number of foreclosures is expected to rise."

In May, the U.S. economy added 217,000 new jobs, after similar job growth in the previous three months, although unemployment in May remained flat at 6.3%. Inflation has also been picking up, with the consumer-price index rising 0.4% on the month in May.

""But the truth is that doesn't seem to be occurring. Businesses are keeping inventories in line with overall activities.""
Fat inventory levels can send mixed economic signals. Rising levels of stocks are healthy if consumers are buying the items. But if businesses overestimate demand, they can be stuck holding goods they can't sell.

He hopes Wednesday's move will push down long-term borrowing rates benchmarked to Treasury bonds, from car loans to mortgage debt to corporate bonds. But it could backfire and fuel fears that the Fed, by using its power to print money to help the government finance soaring budget deficits, is kindling inflation. Those fears could, paradoxically, send Treasury yields higher.
The market's initial reaction was mostly positive. Treasury yields dropped sharply, as previous research conducted by Mr. Bernanke suggested would happen. The Bank of England's decision earlier this month to begin purchasing government debt provided comfort that the move would work. Yields on British gilts have declined by roughly half a percentage point after it decided to buy gilts.
An explosion of federal borrowing had started to put upward pressure on Treasury yields, said Brian Sack, an economist at Macroeconomic Advisers LLC. ""Fed purchases could relieve some of that pressure and have a meaningful impact on yields.""
But in a hint of potential worries among investors about the Fed flooding the economy with even more money, the dollar dropped against the euro and the yen. The euro landed at $1.34 in late trading, up from $1.30 the day before, the biggest one-day gain since its birth in 1999."

The Fed, which has already raised interest rates six times this year in an unsuccessful attempt to cool the red-hot economy, could act again at a policy-making session today. But analysts said the central bank is more likely to wait until it meets next on Jan. 31.
Many analysts now predict that to curb the economy's robust growth, the Fed will have to provide such a harsh dose of interest rate medicine - raising short-term interest rates at least a percentage point on top of this year's increases of 2.5 percentage points - that it will eventually plunge the economy into recession.
""There is less and less chance of a soft landing and a higher and higher chance of the more traditional boom-and-bust cycle,"" said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Norwest Bank in Minneapolis.
In its latest forecast, Merrill Lynch & Co. said last week that strong economic growth in early 1995 could lead the Fed to raise rates ""by more than we currently expect. In that case, the U.S. economy would probably decelerate more sharply by late 1995 and possibly into a recession in 1996."""

In its first pass at calculating growth for the July-through- September quarter, the Commerce Department estimated that gross domestic product -- a broad measure of the economy's physique -- rose at an annual rate of 3.9%, up a tick from the second quarter's 3.8% growth and besting the guesses of 24 Wall Street shamans surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires. Their consensus call was 3.2% GDP growth during the quarter. True enough, there was housing-related softness in the report, as residential investment tumbled 20% and zapped more than a percentage point of growth out of the final number. But there were plenty of off-setting bright spots, such as the undaunted millions piloting our national fleet of shopping carts. Consumer spending is the biggest component of GDP and it climbed 3% during the third quarter after posting more of a pipsqueak percentage, 1.4%, during the spring quarter. There were other signs of strength too, especially in exports, which shot up 16% thanks in part to the falling dollar, and business spending, which saw a 7.9% bump. In a separate report, U.S. construction spending unexpectedly jumped in September, with government-financed projects picking up the slack in the housing sector.
Alas, nothing is simple for Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his elite squad of econo-wonks, who are, as of this writing, putting final flourishes on their latest masterpiece of a press release announcing their decision on interest rates. (It's due at 2:15 p.m.). The rosier- than-expected GDP and construction numbers might not have much bearing on the Fed's decision-making, which most handicappers expect will produce a quarter-percentage-point cut in the federal funds rate. That is mostly because these numbers offer a slightly stale view of the economy. ""The question now is how well it can withstand even steeper declines in residential construction, the general tightening in credit conditions, falling house prices, oil prices at around $90 per barrel, and their negative implications for consumer and business spending,"" wrote Nigel Gault, an economist with research firm Global Insight. Such stresses would help make the case for easier credit.
But not all dismal scientists discounted today's GDP figures. At Nomura Securities, analysts wrote that ""the surprising GDP strength could be enough to persuade the FOMC to defer any decision about the need for another rate cut until a clearer picture of the fourth quarter has formed."" And analysts with Bear Stearns wrapped up their GDP commentary by noting refound strength in an employment report from payroll processing giant ADP. ""With the evidence [from this morning's ADP report] suggesting that private payrolls grew around 100,000 in October, and with back-to-back quarters of near 4% real GDP growth, the economic argument for a further rate cut at this point is unclear to us."" In any event, investors will be surprised with anything other than a quarter-point rate cut today, as they were pegging the chances for such a snip -- via fed-funds futures -- at more than 90% early in the day

This relationship, in which short-term rates drop below long-term rates, is known as a ""positive yield curve"" and is often viewed as a sign that investors are expecting stable or possibly higher long-term interest rates down the road.
If the positive yield curve remains that way, it could also signal that the powerful bond market rally ""may be close to its end,"" said Charles Lieberman, a managing director at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp.
The yield curve had been ""inverted"" for most of the past three months. That's an unusual configuration where long-term bond yields stand below the yields on short-term Treasury bills."

The fact that unemployment sticks around 7 percent disturbs consumer confidence - not only among those out of work, but among people who still have jobs.

If it meets expectations, the deficit would be the smallest since 1989. As a percentage of the nation's total economic output, or gross domestic product, the deficit, at 2.3%, would be the smallest since 1979, the CBO said.

Without efforts to reduce federal spending, as have been proposed by congressional Republicans, the deficit would reach $350 billion by 2002, the CBO said.

While the Obama administration discusses additional stimulus packages, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner is arguing that we should roll back key elements of the Bush tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003. The administration is particularly skeptical about the benefits of today's lower rates on dividends and capital gains.
The tax on dividends, for example, is currently 15%, but it could increase to as high as 39.6% if the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts expire. On top of this, a new 3.8% tax on investment incomes for high-income earners begins in 2013 to help pay for ObamaCare. The administration's arguments for higher taxes on capital center on fairness and the need for deficit reduction.
These arguments are seriously mistaken. The relationship between investment, capital and wages is such that workers are better off if capital is not taxed at all.
Think of the economy as a pie split among workers, savers and the government, with the government's slice fixed. The savers' slice will equal the after-tax return on each unit of the capital stock, and what's left goes to workers as after-tax wages. The fairness advocates in effect claim that low tax rates on dividends and capital gains increase the share of the pie that goes to high-income savers. But the low tax rates increase the absolute size of the workers' slice by making the entire pie bigger. That's because low tax rates encourage capital accumulation, productivity and wage growth.
To understand how this works, it's worthwhile to return to President Bush's proposal, in January 2003, to substantially reduce the double taxation of corporate income by eliminating investor-level taxes on dividends. (The actual law reduced tax rates on dividends and capital gains to 15%.)"

But Ford said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it expects a loss for the just-ended third quarter. Because of economic uncertainty in Europe, and the overall weakness in the U.S. market, Ford said ""losses could extend into the fourth quarter,"" partially offsetting first-half earnings of $840.3 million. However, Ford said results for the full year should ""represent a substantial improvement over 1991 losses"" of $2.3 billion.
This week, Allan D. Gilmour, who heads Ford's world-wide automotive operations, said the company remains committed to its aggressive product development programs despite economic weakness in the U.S. and in Europe, where Ford expects a loss for the year.
""In spite of these weak markets, particularly in Europe, Ford is maintaining its aggressive commitment to invest the resources to bring to market good cars and trucks, and to develop practical, functional technology for these new products,"" Mr. Gilmour said in a speech at the Paris auto show."

Details of the minutes, including the policymakers' conclusion that the economy is in a slump, reinforced the view among many economists that the Fed is not done cutting rates. The economists generally expect the Fed to lower its target to 1.5 percent, probably in two quarter-point steps at meetings scheduled for mid-December and late January.
""The economy appeared to have been growing very little, if at all, prior to the terrorist attacks, and the dislocations arising from the [attacks] seemed to have induced a downturn in overall economic activity,"" the members of the Fed's top policymaking group, the Federal Open Market Committee, concluded, the minutes said.
""Looking ahead, the members generally saw a relatively mild and short contraction followed by a gradual recovery next year as a plausible forecast but one that was subject to an unusually wide range of uncertainty, notably in the direction of a potentially much weaker outcome in the nearer term,"" they said.

The Labor Department said the number of first-time claims for jobless benefits climbed by an unexpectedly large 7,000 last week while a longer-term gauge hit its highest level in nearly two years. The numbers suggest that the jobless rate will increase in coming months.
Still, the unemployment picture has yet to take a bite out of consumer's confidence in the economy. The University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment actually increased in November, surprising analysts expecting a decline due to stock-market weakness and continuing election uncertainty. The index finished the month at 107.6, nearly two points higher than its 105.8 level in October and only a few points below the record set in January.
The report offered a burst of good news for the nation's retailers, who have seen their stock prices battered in recent weeks amid evidence of slackening sales and dire predictions for a relatively weak holiday-shopping season. Most retailers' fortunes rest on the crowds of shoppers who flock to their stores between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day.
The new data suggest that such fears may be groundless. ""With the index at these levels, it would still be reasonable to expect robust growth in consumer spending,"" said Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist of High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y."

The orders report is a crude and highly volatile measure of business activity, but it does suggest the economy may be slowing more sharply than most economists have predicted.
Orders for non-defense capital goods, an indicator of business plans to invest in new equipment, plunged 6.3% in August, following a 2.5% decline in July and a 3.2% drop in June. Many analysts had been counting on business investment to propel the economy in coming months, now that consumer spending seems to have slowed. But if orders for capital goods continue to decline and consumer spending stays weak, the economic expansion could fizzle out in the next few months.

But these are not normal times, and anyone who is not afraid after a 50% market decline has a few screws loose. The trick is to channel your fear into sensible action that will improve your financial future.
Instead of big impulsive steps you may regret later, you should take small and careful steps that will make you feel you have taken charge. Mental-health experts have found that merely believing you have some control over a painful situation is enough to make the pain more bearable. At a time like this, taking a little bit of action can give you a lot of comfort -- both as an immediate salve for your market wounds today and as a portfolio strengthener in the years to come.
For investors, that means being deliberate in everything you do and making sure that all your decisions are gradual and incremental, rather than sudden and drastic. Call it ""smart panic"" -- calculated actions that free you from the chains of inertia without compelling you to go haywire.
Normally, inertia keeps investors locked into all their investments, good and bad. As Sir Isaac Newton might have put it, an investor at rest stays at rest, and an investor in motion stays in motion, unless acted upon by an outside force. Severe losses can shock any investor out of inertia, often in destructive ways.
Here is a list of constructive steps you can take instead:"
830983776,the-biggest-boom-ever,wapo_408566205,2000-01-26,"We are about to rewrite history. Unless a recession begins in the next few days, this boom will soon become the longest in the American experience. In February, it will have lasted 107 months. The current record is 106 months between February 1961 and December 1969, according to the dating of business cycles by the National Bureau of Economic Research. By and large, Americans are behaving as if recessions are a relic of the past, even though everyone must realize that the boom will end someday--and might end badly.
As with all records, people will celebrate and assert bragging rights. President Clinton always claims credit and will almost certainly repeat the claims in tomorrow's State of the Union. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, is idolized for his presumed role. The murkier truth is that the boom's causes remain obscure and, to the extent they can be identified, reflect a protracted and largely nonpolitical process.
Low inflation has been the critical catalyst. In the past, rising inflation has doomed expansions through higher interest rates, increased labor costs and squeezed profits. Consumer spending, housing construction and business investment all suffered. Yet, inflation now remains tame. By various measures, it's running between 1 percent and slightly more than 2 percent a year. This is lower than in 1990 (between 4 percent and 6 percent by the same measures) and defies the conventional tendency of inflation to worsen as the economy ""heats up."" * The Fed: Paul Volcker, chairman of the Fed between 1979 and 1987, crushed inflationary expectations. In the 1960s and 1970s, these had become ingrained. Companies raised prices because they expected customers would pay. Workers expected pay raises to compensate for higher prices--and then some. The Fed blessed the process by creating more money. Its permissive policies rested on the prevailing--but faulty--theory that a bit of inflation aided economic growth. By 1980 inflation had reached double digits. Volcker tightened money, increased interest rates and caused a savage recession. In 1982 unemployment neared 11 percent. Though brutal, the downturn stifled wage and price increases. By 1983 inflation was 4 percent. President Reagan sanctioned Volcker's policy by muting criticism. Since then, Greenspan's Fed has pursued ""price stability"" and has raised interest rates (as in 1994) to prevent inflation's upward creep. Presidents Bush and Clinton have emulated Reagan's self- restraint.
* Better Management: Through the 1970s, corporate managers were rarely fired. Their job tenure rivaled university professors'. In the 1980s, things changed. Managers became vulnerable to job loss for many reasons: the recession; foreign competition; deregulation in the airline, trucking and communications industries; ""hostile"" corporate takeovers; the growth of new discounters (Wal-Mart, Home Depot). Self- preservation made managers more ruthless. They cut costs to raise profits. Old plants were shut. Layoffs and ""downsizings"" became common. Again, the immediate consequences were often cruel and (as with Volcker's recession) widely deplored. But the lasting effect was less inflationary behavior.
* New Technology: As everyone knows, business investment in computers and communications has exploded. The presumption is that these investments enable companies to do things faster and cheaper-- they raise ""productivity."" Firms can minimize unneeded inventories or speed the processing of customer orders. Higher productivity can be magical. If a company improves productivity 3 percent, it can raise wages 3 percent without increasing prices or sacrificing profits. And productivity has improved. In recent years, it's approached 3 percent a year, up from 1.6 percent in the 1980s."

No, Asia's currency troubles of recent months are not one of them. Most economists figure the cause and effects of the turmoil in the currency markets may have a modest negative impact on the U.S. economy but won't derail the expansion -- now six and a half years old and the third longest on record.
More troublesome, they say, is that for the first time since the end of the last recession in early 1991, businesses are borrowing faster than consumers. The longer this trend persists, economists believe, the greater the chances for a supply/demand imbalance that leaves too many goods and services for too few buyers.
""The risk to the economy now is overproduction,"" of everything from bagels to athletic shoes to sports utility vehicles, says Merrill Lynch & Co. chief investment strategist Charles Clough. He is concerned that the unusually high debt burden consumers are carrying has finally prompted them to rein in spending. And the combination of weak sales and strong factory output spells trouble for the economy, he said.
And the potential for a glut could increase, says Mr. Clough, if countries in Southeast Asia decide to solve their financial and economic woes by speeding up production and dumping their output in the U.S."

They say that even once the economy rebounds and earnings start growing again, the outsized profit gains of 1999 and 2000 are a thing of the past. Profits in the 1990s, they say, grew out of sync with the rest of the economy, lifted temporarily by tame debt and labor costs, accounting quirks and technology investments that might never yield significant returns.

Over the next decade, the forecasters expect 2.5% annual increases in the consumer-price index.

The problem: Loans that are tied to a variety of interest-rate benchmarks -- some of which aren't necessarily moving in lockstep with Fed action.
Yesterday, the Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.25% -- the central bank's third rate cut since mid-September -- to help ease the credit crunch and reduce the economy's chances of falling into a recession. The moves have helped some borrowers who have seen interest rates on their credit cards and home-equity lines of credit fall. Interest rates on many fixed-rate mortgages also have dropped amid a decline in Treasury yields as investors sought out safe investments.
But rates remain stubbornly high on other loans, including student debt and many adjustable-rate loans made to the same type of subprime borrowers whose troubles are now reverberating throughout the global financial system. These rates remain high because many of these loans are tied to the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, and not to more conventional interest-rate benchmarks such as Treasurys or banks' prime rate.
Libor, which is an interest rate banks charge on loans to each other, normally tracks the federal-funds rate closely. But continuing worries over the credit crisis have kept Libor unusually high -- partly because banks are reluctant to lend to one another -- even as other short-term interest rates have fallen in recent months. The U.S. dollar three-month Libor yesterday was 5.11%, down from 5.36% in late June. Over the same period, three-month Treasury bill yields have fallen much more steeply, to 2.95% from 4.8%. ""The Libor spread is screaming that there is a big, big stress point in the banking system,"" says James Bianco, president of Bianco Research LLC, a market-research firm in Chicago.
Borrowers may need to read the fine print of their loan agreement or contact their lender to know what benchmark their loan is tied to. The biggest impact is likely to be felt among borrowers with ARMs that are about to reset. ""If you have a Libor-indexed ARM and you're facing a reset, that's going to be very disadvantageous because of the divergence between the Libor and Treasury yields,"" says Greg McBride, a senior financial analyst at Bankrate.com."

And that could mean further increases in interest rates.
In some industries, factories already are operating at close to capacity and price increases are proliferating, these economists said. Although inflation isn't likely to return to double-digit territory, some analysts said they foresee consumer prices rising at a 6%-to-7% annual clip later this year, up sharply from last year's 3.8% increase.
Moreover, some economists predicted that the U.S. dollar will tumble in the foreign-exchange markets this year. That would make imported goods more expensive in the U.S., intensifying inflationary pressures. As the inflation rate rises, investors will demand higher interest rates to compensate for the loss of the dollar's buying power, these analysts said.
The dollar's fate ""is the wild card in the outlook for inflation and interest rates,"" said David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services Inc., Chicago. ""The dollar will fall at least 10%"" this year against other major currencies, he contended. There is an even chance that the dollar could plunge 20%, he added.
Mr. Hale predicted that the inflation rate will rise to between 5% and 6% by autumn. The closely watched interest rate on federal funds, which has hovered at about 9 1/2% in recent months, will rise to the 10% to 11% area by year end, he said.

Even if the Fed leaves policy unchanged, some analysts warn that short-term interest will continue to push higher, partly because they expect credit demands to remain strong.

Home sales have been disappointing this year, with tight credit and weak demand making it harder for markets to absorb a steady stream of foreclosed properties.
""Clearly the market is not functioning as it should,"" said Federal Reserve Governor Elizabeth Duke in a speech Thursday in Washington.
Though mortgage rates are hovering near the lowest levels in decades and the Fed pledged last month to keep interest rates close to zero for another two years, many Americans haven't been able to refinance their home loans because they don't have enough equity or they can't qualify under rigid standards.
Ms. Duke said that policy makers should consider enhancing an existing White House program designed to facilitate more refinancing of loans guaranteed by government-supported mortgage firms Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Allowing more homeowners to take advantage of low interest rates to reduce their monthly payments could both lower the risk of future defaults and boost the weak U.S. economic recovery."

China's admonition came in reaction to the U.S. Commerce Department's decision to open an investigation into the sales of about $1 billion worth of Chinese bedroom sets in the United States, following complaints from American producers that these goods are being sold at below fair market prices -- a practice known as dumping. In petitions, U.S. furniture manufacturers have asserted that they have been unfairly harmed by a surge of such goods.
The furniture spat comes amid continuing signs that trade may intensify as a political issue in the months before next year's presidential election in the United States.

But Americans are still reaching for their wallets more than Federal Reserve decision makers would like.
Personal income jumped 0.7% last month while consumer spending rose 0.5%, the Commerce Department said. Adjusted for inflation, core consumer spending inched up just 0.3%. Inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures index, was unchanged at 0.2%. The savings rate bounced back to 1.4% after hitting a record low of 1% in December.
The numbers, which suggest Americans are thinking twice about some purchases, represent an about-face from December when personal income grew just 0.3% and consumer spending surged a revised 1.1%. Core consumer spending climbed 0.9%.
The increase in personal income, which includes wages, interest and government benefits, was boosted by pay increases for federal civilian and military personnel, agricultural subsidies, and cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security and other programs. Excluding the special factors, such as a 1.3% rise in government wage expenditures, the largest monthly gain since January 1993, income would have advanced 0.6%.
Still, consumer spending, an important driver of the nation's economy, shows few real signs that it's easing up.

""The economy is like a sleeping tiger waiting to be awakened by a very strong economy,"" said Allen Sinai, president of Boston Co.'s Economic Advisors Inc. unit. ""And the fourth quarter looks extremely strong,"" he added.
The overall CPI index has been climbing by 0.3% or 0.4% each month during the past half year, for an annual rate increase of 4.6%. Mr. Sinai figures that the annual rate could speed up to 5.5% to 6% in the not-too-distant future.
Food and energy, the CPI's two most volatile components, have been relatively stable recently. But economists say that food price increases seem moderate largely because the drought-induced runup last summer is abating. And oil prices aren't fully reflecting recent increases in crude oil quotations, they added."

The Conference Board's confidence index dropped 10.7 points to 109 in September, compared with a revised 119.7 in August. The seasonally adjusted index uses 1985 as a base of 100. The September index was down 6.7 points from the year-earlier level of 115.7. In November 1987, a month after the crash, the index dropped 14.3 points to 100.8.
""It is still too early to say what may have shaken consumer confidence in September,"" said Fabian Linden, executive director of the board's Consumer Research Center. ""Although a single month's reading is inconclusive, the decline in confidence is too large and widespread to be dismissed as merely a technical aberration. The latest economic statistics, showing personal income rising only about half as fast as prices, may well have caused some consumer uneasiness. Still, the present confidence figure remains well above the level that generally signals recession.""
All sections of the country registered downturns in confidence about the present economic scene as well as expectations about the future situation in the Board's September survey, which is conducted by National Family Opinion Inc., Toledo, Ohio. The Conference Board is an industry-supported, nonprofit economic research group.
""One of the purposes of the consumer confidence survey is that it gives warning signals,"" Mr. Linden said. ""We're getting warning signals."" The only positive thing about the latest survey, Mr. Linden said was that the index stood above a recession's ""historical trigger level"" of about 80. ""We're still well above a disaster level."""

Domenici proposed capping cost-of-living increases in entitlement programs, the automatic spending engines such as Medicaid, Medicare and federal retirement that are exempt from annual congressional review.
For years, these politically sensitive programs that make up more than half the $1.4 trillion in annual federal spending have been kept largely off-limits to budget cutters, despite their awesome impact on the deficit. As Domenici soon discovered, tampering with those programs is explosive business.
Even before his proposal took shape, more than 3,000 New Mexico constituents sent him identical postcards opposing any effort to cap entitlement programs."

By year end, most every investor had reason to smile. The Dow, up 33.45%, edged out most of the mutual funds, but even those laggards had a good year. And all these gains came with little queasiness. According to Ned Davis Research Inc., Nokomis, Fla., the Dow's biggest correction in 1995 was a record low 3.3%. In addition, Ned Davis Research says the Dow, which hit its last bear market bottom in October 1990, has put in its longest run ever without a 10% correction.
But the spectacular year required something akin to a razor's edge dance by the economy. The enriching combination of modest growth with good profits -- the so-called soft landing -- came about despite a great deal of cynicism that it could ever happen.
Can that perfect combination continue? Most analysts now say yes. Sort of. Few expect another raucous year with gains of more than 30%. Instead, the bull market will have a return to normalcy, with consensus expectations hovering around a 10% return for the year.
Of course, it must be noted early on that many chin-scratchers erred badly in their 1995 outlooks a year ago. The consensus expected some sort of correction in the stock market, with prices moving higher later in the year. But hardly anyone thought the Dow would cruise past 5000."

The positive effect of that pressure is that a rise in short-term interest rates isn't likely over the next 12 months, and longterm rates could decline further, she added. Moreover, her reading of economic figures and anecdotal evidence from corporate members of the Conference Board indicate that ""the talk about an increase in inflation is absolutely crazy.""

In its annual Industrial Outlook, a detailed analysis of 250 goods-producing industries and more than 130 service-sector industries, the department forecasts that about 70% of U.S. manufacturing industries will record increased shipments.
At a news conference Wednesday, Deputy Commerce Secretary Clarence Brown said the department's most optimistic forecasts estimate that the merchandise trade gap could narrow by as much as $40 billion this year.
The deficit in 1986 is believed to have swelled to as much as $170 billion, and many private economists anticipate less improvement in 1987 than Mr. Brown suggested. In a separate report released yesterday, the department said the nation's merchandise trade deficit expanded to a record $19.22 billion in November.
Mr. Brown said manufactured exports are expected to grow faster than imports for the first time since 1980. The improving trade balance, he said, is due to the dollar's decline against major foreign currencies, U.S. efforts to encourage more-balanced growth and trade-liberalization abroad, and strict enforcement of U.S. trade laws."

The large revision in the inflation-adjusted gross national product, the nation's total output of goods and services, was due principally to an unexpected reduction in December's trade deficit from the earlier estimate. For its earlier GNP report, the department had estimated that the December trade deficit would approach $10 billion, but in fact the deficit, as reported three weeks ago, was $8.2 billion. The deficit is a negative factor in calculating the GNP.
Most analysts believe the easing in the trade deficit is temporary, resulting from the economy's slowdown in the third quarter. They expect the rapid growth of the economy in the fourth quarter, combined with the continued strength of the dollar, to cause the deficit to get even larger next year.
The economy grew at a sluggish 1.6% rate in the third quarter. GNP in the fourth quarter of 1984 was 5.9% over the fourth quarter of 1983, rather than 5.6% as reported last month. And the full-year's output was 6.9% higher than in 1983, rather than 6.8% as previously reported.

Whenever there were signs that the pace of growth was picking up, the so-called vigilantes would rush to sell, driving interest rates higher and acting as a brake on the economy.
But if last week was any indication, a new era may be upon us.
The market is soaring. The yield on the benchmark 30-year bond plummeted to 6.37% from 6.69% in just the past six trading days.

WASHINGTON -- There are signs that the long downward spiral of the U.S. manufacturing sector may have hit bottom.
The Commerce Department reported Friday that orders for durable goods, items meant to last three years or longer, rose a stronger- than-expected 2.1% in June, the largest gain in nearly a year. Shipments rose 1.3% in June and unfilled orders increased 0.1%. Orders for May, meanwhile, were revised upward to unchanged from a previously estimated decline of 0.4%.
While the improvement in orders is hardly enough to signal that manufacturing is out of the woods, it may suggest that the long- suffering industry could be poised for better times ahead. ""I think manufacturing has turned the corner,"" said Ken Mayland, economist at ClearView Economics in Cleveland. Economists had expected durable- goods orders to show strong growth in June based on improvement in several regional manufacturing surveys. However, the size of the June gain was larger than most had anticipated.
David Rosenberg, chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch & Co., said the durable-goods report, when combined with other recent positive economic news, means that economic growth in the third quarter will show an improvement compared with the anemic second quarter.

In a bold attempt to redirect the fiscal debate this year, the Illinois Democrat derided as politically expedient the growing interest among prominent members of both parties to cut taxes and to avoid making the hard choices that he said are needed to reduce the budget deficit.
Instead, he proposed to eschew all tax cuts, raise the top individual tax rate to 33% from 28% and freeze most federal spending programs, including Social Security, for one year. He also would raise taxes on gasoline, beer, wine, cigarettes and industrial pollutants, and would cut military spending by 3% from current levels. The goal of his five-year, $511.6 billion plan is to eliminate the projected budget deficit by the end of fiscal 1994 and create surpluses each year thereafter.
But the Rostenkowski plan, or even anything close to it, isn't likely to be enacted this year as long as President Bush opposes major tax increases and cuts in Social Security. On CBS-TV's ""Face the Nation"" yesterday, Mr. Rostenkowski acknowledged his plan is controversial. He said that he expected to be ""verbally hazed by both Democrats and Republicans"" and that the few colleagues he told about his plan asked, ""Do you know what you're doing?""
What's more, efforts to cut taxes, especially President Bush's plan to reduce the tax on capital gains, have a good chance of passage this year over Mr. Rostenkowski's objections, according to Ways and Means aides. The capital-gains plan, which passed the House last year, is supported by a solid though narrow majority of the 36 members on Mr. Rostenkowski's own Ways and Means Committee."

With a tone of despair, New York hanker Robert V. Roosa, sometimes mentioned as a possible successor to Arthur F. Burns at the Federal Reserve, makes a â–  sarcastic reference to the â€œsinking dollarâ€ù and what he terms the ""benign neglect"" policy of the U.S. government.
Roosa wants the United States, West Germany, and Japan to intervene in foreign exchange markets to support agreed-upon rates for the Big Three nationsâ€™ currencies. Burns himself, in his best stentorian tones, warns a congressional committee that â€œwe dare not be complacent about the current depreciating tendencies of the dollar.â€ù
Burnsâ€™ concerns now are echoed routinely by Treasury Secretary W. Michael Blumenthal, who in every speech and congressional appearance swears on a stack of Bibles that he is not trying to depress the dollar to get a competitive advantage for U.S. exports. Eearlier this year, Blumenthal incurred the wrath of the German and Japanese governmentsâ€”and of Burnsâ€”
In an interview with this reporter on July 21, Blumenthal said, ""I would be quite happy to live with whatever the result (of exchange rate fluctuation) is.â€ù
To our competitors in West Germany and Japan, that sounded as if Blumenthal was talking the dollar down in an effort to reduce the massive U.S. trade deficit, now estimated at $30 billion.

As goes government spending, so goes the U.S. economy.
This is the unpleasant reality a weak recovery and already stretched Federal Reserve have bequeathed. Absent a sudden pick-up in private-sector activity, economic growth in the months ahead will largely take its cue from Congress and the White House. No wonder markets are jittery.
For one, the hit from spending cuts across all levels of government has already been a major drag on growth. Indeed, these declines shaved 0.7 percentage point on average from gross domestic product growth in the first two quarters of 2011. Typically, that would be no disaster. Trouble is, this recovery has been unusually weak. So the government cutbacks effectively halved real GDP growth in the first half of 2011, leaving it at just 0.8% annualized.
The pace of underlying growth is expected to pick up a bit in coming months. But so, too, is the pace of government spending cuts. A glimpse of this will come Wednesday with the release of July federal budget figures. These are expected to show a third month in a row of year-on-year declines in spending, or ""outlays,"" according to a preliminary analysis from the Congressional Budget Office. Their estimates show spending is down nearly 12% on average since May from a year earlier."

The euro declined by more than a full U.S. cent to $1.5360, its lowest level in more than a month. This comes a week after the currency climbed to a historical high of $1.6020. Also Friday, the dollar increased to its highest level since February against the yen.
U.S. employment fell in April for the fourth-straight month, but at a much slower pace than previously, suggesting the economy may be starting to find its footing after several months of stagnation. The dollar took this as positive news.

The Agriculture Department is standing by its forecast for unusually tame food-price inflation this year but warned Monday that the broad rally in farm commodity prices since midsummer will take a bigger bite out of consumers' wallets next year.
In its monthly food-price inflation forecast released Monday, the USDA stuck with the prediction it first made in late August that the government's widely followed consumer-price index for food will rise between 0.5% and 1.5% this year, which would be the smallest increase since 1992.
The USDA also left unchanged its forecast for retail food prices to climb by a more typical rate of between 2% and 3% in 2011.
But Ephraim Leibtag, the USDA economist responsible for the forecast, said surging prices of commodities such as corn and wheat are increasing the odds that the 2011 food-inflation rate will be at the high end of his forecast range."

He agreed to increase his Carrington investment to $7.5 million by Nov. 30 under the same terms.

Initial claims for jobless aid decreased by 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 302,000 in the week ended July 12, the Labor Department said Thursday. That was the second lowest reading so far this year and was below the 310,000 new claims forecast by economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.

""The improvement has been substantial,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.

A Senate finance subcommittee already has held little-publicized hearings on the proposal, and it is now being promoted before the House Ways and Means Committee as a â€œtax reform.â€ù
The essence of this proposal is that the proportion of a capital gain included in taxable incomeâ€”which now is only 50 per cent, of the gainâ€”should he reduced still further. The proposed reduction would be in steps of 2 per cent a year for each year the asset is hold, up to 15 years. Thus, for stock held for 15 years, only 20 per cent of the gain on its sale would be taxable.
For the wealthiest individuals, those in the 70 per cent lop tax bracket, this proposal would thus reduce their tax on the gain from 35 per cent (70 per cent of 50 per cent of the gain) to only 14 per cent (70 per cent of 20 per cent of the gain). Ironically, 14 per cent is also precisely the rate of tax applicable to the wages of the poorest taxpayers in the country.
Any reduction in the capital gains tax on the sale of stock or other capital assets will primarily benefit high-income families. Recent statistics of income indicate that individuals and families with incomes above $25,000â€” about 3 per cent of all lax returnsâ€”account for around 55 per cent of all capital gains. Taxpayers with more than $100,000 of incomeâ€”about 0.1 per cent of all returnsâ€”receive about 30 per cent of all capital gains."

The new estimates -- most still predicting moderate growth, yet trimming the growth rate by 0.5 percentage point or even more -- are based on a growing belief that U.S. exports to Asia will decline as economic growth there slows. In addition, there's a concern that U.S. consumer spending is weakening even as corporations and retailers continue to expand. Most of the revisions have come in the past week, following a sharp decline in many world markets, and despite a sharp rebound on Wall Street and elsewhere.
The downward revisions to gross domestic product-the government's primary barometer of economic growthcame from economists at Chase Manhattan Bank Corp., Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp., Aubrey G. Lanston & Co., Merrill Lynch & Co., ISI Group and several others. The size of their revisions were unusually large, even for market-oriented economists who react quickly to changing economic news.
Chase Manhattan, the nation's largest banking concern, raised eyebrows when it told clients Tuesday that it revised its 1998 forecast to between 1% and 1.5% from 1.5% to 2%.

The monthly consensus forecast due next week from Blue Chip Economic Indicators, an Alexandria, Va., firm that collects the forecasts of about 50 economists and calculates a consensus, is not likely to show much change, if any, from its early October consensus. The Blue Chip consensus forecast published last month called for growth of 2.5% in 1998, down from an expected 3.6% in 1997. Mr. Lipsky, ISI Group, DLJ and many other Wall Street firms don't participate in the Blue Chip survey."

The latest round of so-called living wills, released by regulators Thursday, showcased the disparate approaches banks plan to take to dismantle their firms in times of severe market stress.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said its ""preferred strategy"" would be to avoid insolvency by recapitalizing its major U.S. and U.K. broker-dealers, as well as other key businesses. Citigroup Inc. would try to sell off its broker-dealer units first before letting the parent company fail under one scenario. Bank of America Corp. said the ""simplest approach"" to winding down its business would be through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by its holding company, with its subsidiaries continuing to operate. If unable to recapitalize its business, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. would sell or divest business lines or conduct a ""rapid and orderly wind down in proceedings"" through bankruptcy.

Ernie Patrikis, a banking partner at law firm White & Case, expressed doubts about how useful the plans would be in times of crisis. ""It is difficult to anticipate where the next major problem will arise,"" he said. ""And you can't just sell or shut down companies overnight."""

â–  Metro: The Metro board has ordered General Manager Lawrence G. Reuter to cut District bus service and raise fares if the city does not pay the transit agency the $18 million that it owes by Feb. 1. This isn't a new dispute. In fact, the current city administration has been relying on delays in Metro payments to help balance its annual budget booksâ€”on paper if not in reality. This week, as they have done in the past, the regional board members agreed to allow Mr. Reuter to borrow money to pay Metro's billsâ€” including its payrollâ€”until the District government pays its full, agreed-upon share, plus interest.
If that doesnâ€™t happen, the options Mr. Reuter is considering are shutting down night and weekend bus service in the District; eliminating any bus routes that duplicate rail routes; ending discount fares for schoolchildren; raising the fares for the elderly and disabled from 30 cents to 50 cents; and increasing special 35-cent fares on Anacostia buses to 60 cents.
Some of these economies may have to be made â€¢ even if the city pays its current bill, given the staggering budget problems already confronting a government in transition and under strict congressional orders. But mass transit in the city is not a designated charity for suburban taxpayers.

While this may yield some savings for the individual governments, it tends to raise overhead costs for the remaining regional bus and rail services.

The ""twin deficits"" are turning America into a banana republic. The weight of debt threatens turmoil in the Third World. Only urgent action will save the day: The dollar must fall and taxes must rise.
Sound familiar? It should, because such dread and dismay have been the conventional economic wisdom, at least among political and media elites, on the eve of every economic summit in the 1980s. Just a year or even six months ago, the apocalyptics were still in full cry. So as the decade's last economic summit unfolds in Paris after yet another year of growth, it's as good a time as any to examine how wrong the fear and loathing has been.
My favorite doomsayer is Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economics, a frequently quoted outfit that has served as an inverse indicator during the 1980s; whatever it says will happen almost certainly won't. Last May, Mr. Marris told the Business Council that, ""If the next president of the United States . . . does not act immediately and decisively to cut the budget deficit, he is going to preside over the decline and fall of this great nation.""
Mr. Marris was building on his earlier insight, offered in 1984, that ""time is running out."" If $150 billion wasn't cut from the U.S. budget deficit by 1987, he wrote, ""the present recovery in both the United States and the rest of the world will come to an untimely end."" Alas the recovery, like the nation, keeps rolling along.
It's unfair to single out Mr. Marris, so let's widen the memory net. Fred Bergsten, his partner in prophecy at IIE, wrote last November that, ""there is still time to avert disaster,"" if only then President-elect Bush would raise taxes and devalue the dollar. He wrote the same thing in 1984, too, and in 1985, and . . ."

On a monthly basis, the consumer-price index was unchanged in April from March, the Labor Department said Friday. However the core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, jumped 0.3% last month, the largest increase since June 2008. A 9.3% rise in tobacco prices generated about 40% of the core CPI increase as a federal excise tax kicked in. It was the second-straight month that tobacco lifted the core index.
Separately, U.S. industrial production fell 0.5% in April, its 15th decline in 16 months, an indication that businesses continue to draw down inventories in the face of weak demand. Meanwhile, a gauge of consumer sentiment by Reuters and the University of Michigan rose to 67.9 in mid-May, from 65.1 in April. That suggests some improvement in confidence, although the index remains low by historical standards.
""I still think there are some sources of optimism,"" White House economic adviser Austan Goolsbee said in an interview Friday. But until the economy stops shedding more than 500,000 jobs a month, he said, ""keep your hands and arms inside the car with your seatbelt fastened. We've still got a bumpy ride to go.""
Consumer prices fell 0.7% compared with one year ago, the largest 12-month decline since June 1955. It's also significantly under the 2% annual rate of inflation that most Federal Reserve officials think is consistent with their dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment."

But the Maple Leaf is meeting new competition on several fronts. Sales of the four-year-old decorative Chinese coin, the Panda, have surged. Luis Vigdor, senior vice president of Manfra, Tordella & Brookes Inc., the large New York foreign-exchange dealer, calls it the ""hottest coin on the market.""

Although gold coins have lost the enormous appeal they had in 1980 -- when inflation propelled gold to record high prices -- they may be ready for a modest comeback. Many gold bugs see inflation returning, and with it, coin buying. Some feel the introduction of the American gold coin will also revive the market. It will act ""like an injection of vitamins"" into the U.S. gold market, says Mr. Vigdor.
For prospective coin buyers, the most important consideration is a coin's liquidity. ""You want to be certain that in two years or 10, you can resell it,"" says Mr. Nichols. Coins' purity and weight also vary; one-ounce coins are the most popular among investors."

President Obama has urged us to be ""patient"" with this jobless recovery. But it's worth asking how long it will take to get back to the employment levels we experienced before the recession of 2008-09. How patient will we need to be?
Consider the math of full employment. We now have a labor force of 153 million people, of whom 14 million are officially counted as ""unemployed,"" defined as not working and actively seeking a job. Were we fully employed (defined as 5% unemployment) there would be 7.7 million unemployed workers. So our ""excess"" unemployment currently hovers around 6.3 million workers.

Aside from auto dealers, however, most other retailers -- including department stores, clothing stores and building-supply dealers -- reported healthy gains in sales. And the department made a large upward revision to its calculation of January retail sales, to a 2.8% increase from its original estimate of 1.6%
January's rise, just as February's decline, was influenced heavily by car buying. In January, car sales rocketed 9.9%, according to the department; in February, they plunged 6%. Looking beyond the erratic auto figures, most economists said the retail numbers indicate consumer spending is sound enough to keep the economy growing.
""There is enough life in these numbers to suggest that consumer spending isn't deteriorating further,"" said George Iwanicki, an economist at Kidder, Peabody & Co. in New York. However, Mr. Iwanicki said the report ""doesn't answer the question of whether the demand side of the economy is really rebounding.""
The economy slowed sharply in the fourth quarter of 1989, hurt partly by the California earthquake, a strike at Boeing Co. and a severe slowdown in consumer spending. Higher prices on 1990 car models were a big factor behind consumers' reticence."

The upgrade to A3 from Baa1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. was certainly good news for scores of investors who own city debt, either through mutual funds or by holding individual bonds. Both the current rating and the old one are ""investment grade,"" but the one-notch upgrade could mean that more mutual funds and other institutional investors will buy city debt. Many institutions are restricted by their own rules in the amount of debt they can own in the B-rated category, where New York City had been.
Moody's action, which applied to the city's general-obligation bond, was the first upgrade for such bonds since 1988, during former Mayor Edward Koch's administration and just before the city entered a deep recession. In fact, less than three years ago Standard & Poor's Ratings Group, the other big ratings house, downgraded city bonds to BBB-plus from A-minus.
Market analysts said that city debt prices were largely unchanged by the news, but could improve in the days and weeks to come as more investors decide to buy New York debt again. Like Moody's, Standard & Poor's is seeing the city in a different light, and officials there said they are considering an upgrade of city bonds after New York releases its new budget.
Can investors sleep tight knowing the rating agencies are keeping close tabs on the city's fiscal health? If you own city debt, you may want to study up on the last time bond raters said the city's finances were improving. In November 1987, Standard & Poor's upgraded city bonds just weeks after the stock market's crash; the market's tailspin caused massive layoffs on Wall Street, a citywide recession and, eventually, lower bond prices. Market participants said S&P didn't anticipate then how seriously New York City would be hurt by the crash."

842613580,the-outlook----after-the-rise:-the-market's-message,wsj_397985510,1984-08-13,"NEW YORK -- Anyone who questions the remarkable relationship that binds the economy and the stock market should ponder briefly the circumstances that immediately preceded the recent surge in share prices. On July 31, the Commerce Department announced that its composite index of leading economic indicators dropped 0.9% in June. And on Aug. 1, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 19.33 points. Further steep increases followed, so that by last week's end the average was 102.81 points above its July 31 level.
There's no short, simple explanation of the linkage between the economy and stock market. But any serious effort to appraise one's prospects entails close attention to the other. An obvious tie involves profits. If it becomes clear that a company's profits are on the rise, demand for its shares is likely to increase, tending to push up their price. A subtler connection involves interest rates. Securities that offer fixed rates of interest compete for investors' dollars with common stocks, which offer dividends that may rise or fall according to changes in profitability. When interest rates fall, this renders interest-paying securities relatively less attractive. It's no coincidence that in general before the recent market surge profits were sharply on the rise and interest rates on the decline.
In all, a wide variety of factors can play upon the market. Among them are shifts in investor confidence, concern about rising or falling prices, worry over higher taxes or stiffer governmental regulations, changes in so-called margin requirements that limit what investors may borrow to buy stocks, the flow of money from overseas, major strikes and the failure of a large corporation. But business-cycle history leaves little doubt that the fundamental influence is the broad economic trend.
The 0.9% drop in the Commerce Department's leading-indicator index in June has been widely interpreted as a signal that the economy, at the least, will grow at a slower pace in coming months. This, in turn, has been seen as a good reason to invest in common stocks, since a slower-paced expansion would presumably last longer and be accompanied by somewhat lower interest rates.
The record shows, however, that a decline of only a month or two in the leading-indicator index by no means guarantees an economic slowing. In fact, the June drop was the first monthly decline since August 1982. Moreover, it's possible that subsequent revisions in the various components of the Commerce index may eventually turn the decline into an increase. Several times since August 1982 reported monthly declines in the index have indeed been revised into gains."

So the Labor Department's report yesterday that productivity of U.S. businesses fell 1.2 percent in the three months ending in June sounds like bad news - if it's accurate.
The Labor Department attributed the decline to increases in hours worked and in the number of people working, as revealed by its survey of employers. But the department's survey of households shows that the number of people working has grown about one-sixth as much as the employer survey says. And if the household survey is right, then the work force has not grown as much, and productivity probably has not fallen as much, which is better news for the economy.
It's not easy to get a handle on precisely what is happening in an economy undergoing big changes in what businesses produce, how well they produce it and whom they hire to produce it. Reliance on any one statistic may lead to misjudging the height of the forest based on one misshapen tree.

Spending on everything from vacations to clothes was largely flat in June.

Consumer spending is the biggest single driver of the U.S. economy, accounting for roughly two-thirds of demand.

McDonald's jumped $1.91, or 2.6%, to $75.36, after the fast-food chain said sales at stores open more than a year rose 5.3% in January from a year earlier, topping the 3.1% rise expected. It cited the diversity of its menu and the addition of oatmeal to it.
The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 13.06, or 0.5%, to 2797.05, the highest close since Nov. 6, 2007. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 5.52, or 0.4%, to 1324.57, the highest close since June 19, 2008.
The consumer sector was the best-performing category in the S&P 500, with McDonald's giving a boost and Urban Outfitters also strong. Shares of the teen retailer leapt 1.95, or 5.6%, to 37.06, after Citigroup raised its stock rating to ""hold"" from ""sell,"" noting inventory and sales growth are getting more in sync."

He disputed the forecast of some analysts that interest rates will turn up again later this year when the expected recovery boosts business loan demand again at the same time the Treasuryâ€™s own borrowing needs are rising sharply.
Rates will fall â€œnot sharply, not plummeting in a straight line, but coming down over the period between now and the end of the year,â€ù

830982697,investors-await-direction-from-fed-meeting,wapo_409954382,2006-03-25,"-- Wall Street closed out the week with modest gains Friday, though trading was erratic as encouraging signs of a cooling housing market conflicted with signals of economic strength and left no real clue as to the Federal Reserve's next move on interest rates.
The Commerce Department reported that new-home sales fell 10.5 percent in February, the biggest one-month drop in nine years. With slowing housing demand, Wall Street thought that would make it easier for the Fed to stop raising rates soon.
A surge in big-ticket factory orders raised questions, however, about whether demand would hold steady, possibly increasing pricing pressure and the chance for higher inflation. The Fed meets Monday and Tuesday, and it is expected to raise the nation's benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 4.75 percent.
While questions remain as to how many more rate increases the Fed will implement, analysts believe stocks still have room to move higher, thanks to a decent economy and the chance for another quarter of strong corporate earnings.

The prospect of a sustained budget surplus ""is a very useful platform to finally get to a point where the Social Security problem is something which is truly resolvable,"" Mr. Greenspan told the Senate Budget Committee. That ""may not be the case a number of years from now,"" he warned, adding that ""it would be a real tragedy if we failed to employ this particular platform as the beginning of the solution to this problem.""
Meanwhile, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said yesterday that simply transferring projected federal surpluses into the Social Security Trust Fund, one of several options expected to come under consideration in the coming debate over reforming the retirement system, would delay the fund's depletion by 10 years.
Offering a preview of administration budget estimates to be released next week, Mr. Summers said surpluses will be projected to be at least $1 trillion over the next 10 years. Every $100 billion transferred into the Social Security fund would extend its life by one year, he said.
Though Mr. Greenspan has no direct role in the budget process, his tremendous credibility on Capitol Hill has made him an influential voice in such debates in recent years. His remarks were particularly striking in putting Social Security above tax cuts in his menu of priorities, placing him in conflict with many congressional Republicans who are pushing to return projected surpluses to taxpayers."

Even an unexpected decline of $300 million in the nation's money supply, reported by the Fed yesterday afternoon, did little to rejuvenate the credit markets. Bond prices slumped about 1/2 point, or around $5 for each $1,000 face amount. That was the third decline in a row, bringing the total drop to nearly two points.
Many analysts are expecting huge increases in the money supply over the next few weeks, partly because of federal income-tax refunds and partly because they expect faster economic growth. Bond traders fear that rapid money growth would intensify investor fears about the inflation outlook and would make the Federal Reserve much less willing to ease credit conditions.
Other Fed figures released yesterday contributed to confusion about Fed policy and the interest-rate outlook. ""People were looking for clear evidence that the Fed had made a decisive move toward an easier policy, but the data didn't provide that,"" said Rudolf Thunberg of Ried, Thunberg & Co., a New Canaan, Conn.-based investment research firm. ""The reserve data suggests that any move the Fed has made is a modest step indeed.""
The federal funds rate, the rate on overnight loans of reserves between banks, ranged between 8.125% and 8.25% most of yesterday. That was up from an average of 7.69% in the week ended Wednesday, which was the lowest weekly average since mid-1978. Bond traders monitor the funds rate closely because it strongly influences many other interest rates, including those that dealers themselves pay to finance their securities holdings."

That's less than a 2.5 percent increase in overall federal taxes. Suppose that ultimately another $25 billion is needed to close the budget deficits. The total still represents less than a 5 percent increase. No one likes to pay higher taxes, but these amounts won't impoverish most Americans or cripple the economy.
How will we get hit? Higher ""sin"" taxes on cigarettes, beer and liquor seem likely. So are steeper ""user fees"" for, say, airline passengers. The impulse of Democrats and Republicans alike is to construct a package of many small-and highly technical-increases so that no one sees much impact. The budget summit should do better than that.
It should not just raise taxes but should do so in a way that makes the overall federal tax system fairer and more efficient. How about a ""carbon tax"": a tax on oil, natural gas and coal? This would depress energy use, air pollution and emissions that contribute to the ""greenhouse effect."" How about taxing capital gains (the profits on the sales of stock or other assets) when people die? Closing this loophole, which benefits mainly the wealthy, could raise at least $2 billion to $3 billion a year.
As they go about this political drudgery, the White House and Congress should adhere to three guidelines:
First, keep income-tax rates low. A tax system with high rates and many special tax breaks (credits, deductions, income exclusions) invites abuse and waste. Hordes of tax lawyers and accountants are deployed to help people and companies minimize their taxes. Investment decisions are skewed by tax breaks. The 1986 tax-reform act was an attempt to get away from this sort of system by lowering tax rates and eliminating some tax breaks. We shouldn't backtrack on it."

The price spike on Friday, the last trading day before today, was triggered by bond-friendly employment news, which eased fears that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month. The Labor Department reported that 124,000 nonfarm employees were added to the nation's payrolls in August, a little less than half of what Wall Street had been expecting. The unemployment rate fell to 4.2% from 4.3% in August.

Unlike in U.S. Treasury and municipal bonds, investors haven't had ready access to comprehensive information on the $3.9 trillion corporate-bond market, prompting former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt to push for a price-reporting system in 1998. Proponents of price-transparency pointed out that corporate bonds account for roughly 20% of the overall market, yet little public information is available on trade volume or pricing.
The SEC finally approved Trace last January, requiring NASD members to report eligible corporate-bond trades to the self-regulatory organization. The NASD will use the information to assist in market surveillance, and will distribute the information on a real-time and delayed basis."

Though not an unexpected trend during economic downturns, the reliance on property taxes has lasted well beyond the end of the recession of 2001. Economists say it is has been of greater depth, and likely will have more lasting consequences, than it did during prior downturns.
In good part, that's because the soaring housing market has lifted the median price of single-family homes by 15%, making property taxes attractive to state and municipal governments facing spending increases. Meanwhile, states have grown more reluctant to lift income or sales taxes in recent years for fear of political retribution, economists say. In some cases, they are even prevented from doing so by laws passed during the 1990s boom.
""The local property tax is one tax the local [authorities] can use to offset declines in state money,"" says William Fischel, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College. ""To some extent, if the state is sending municipalities or even school districts less money because they're in fiscally difficult times, the one tax the local [authorities] have some discretion over raising is the property tax.""
Though municipalities can offset rising property values by changing their millage rates, or the rates at which taxes are levied on properties, many strapped municipalities chose not to do so in recent years.

So much for the cliche of Wall Street versus Main Street, the greedy 1% versus the hard-done-by 99%.

842616056,new-view-into-fed's-response-to-crisis,wsj_1501550491,2014-02-22,"Two days after U.S. officials decided to let Lehman Brothers collapse in September 2008, and just before the Federal Reserve unleashed a torrent of programs to bolster the financial system, central-bank officials were still struggling to grasp the magnitude of the calamity that had hit the economy.
""I think that our policy is looking actually pretty good,"" Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said of the level of interest rates at a closed-door Fed policy meeting on Sept. 16, 2008, according to transcripts of its policy meetings that were released Friday after the traditional five-year lag.
Officials decided at the meeting to hold interest rates steady at 2%. It was one of Mr. Bernanke's last moments of passivity in the financial crisis.
As he spoke, the Fed was moving ahead with plans to help bail out American International Group Inc., the large failing insurer seen as crucial to the financial system. Within days Mr. Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson would go to Congress and make an urgent plea for a bank-bailout plan. By year-end, the Fed chairman had pushed a still-hesitant central bank toward an unprecedented experiment with easy-money policies aimed at reviving the economy.
The Fed transcripts, 1,865 pages documenting one of the most turbulent economic times in the nation's history, covered eight formal and six emergency policy meetings the central bank conducted in 2008. They provide the most complete view yet into developments inside the nation's central bank as the financial crisis worsened and threatened to plunge the U.S. into another Great Depression."
842616519,labor-statistics-are-lying,wsj_398786125,2001-07-10,"On Friday the Labor Department released employment data for June. The employment report is the most important monthly statistical release the government produces and the focus is always on the unemployment rate and the monthly change in payroll employment. The June report showed a slight rise in the unemployment rate to 4.5% and a relatively small fall in payroll employment of 114,000 jobs.
The market took those statistics badly. The stock market sold off, as did the long Treasury bond. Stocks were looking for more cost-cutting measures from companies, in this case a bigger drop in payroll employment. Bonds were looking for a stronger signal that the economy was weak and that the Federal Reserve would continue cutting interest rates.
But there is a little secret in the employment report that you should know about. The Labor Department said that payroll employment fell 114,000 in June. What it did not tell you is that this reported change includes a ""bias adjustment factor"" that adds about 160,000 jobs a month. This bias factor is basically picked out of thin air, and is supposed to capture employment in newly started firms that Labor misses in its survey. In other words, Labor doesn't know how many new hires occurred at new companies, so it assume a number. In its June report, it continued to guess that it missed 155,000 new hires.
The problem is that when the economy slumps, so do new business start-ups. A good indicator of new business starts is the Conference Board's index of help-wanted advertising. This index has plummeted back to levels last seen at the end of the 1990 recession. Back then, the bias factor also fell to zero, instead of hanging at the same level as in the boom period of 1998.
Compare the published payroll survey with another measure of employment, the Labor Department's household survey, which measures employment by asking a survey of people, not businesses, if they have lost their job. The household survey is used to calculate the unemployment rate, but is otherwise ignored because it is very volatile from month to month. Over the past five months this survey shows a fall in employment of more than one million. Over the same five months the published payroll survey has fallen only 45,000. However, if you remove the monthly addition of 155,000 from the bias factor, payroll employment would be down 269,000 in June and 872,000 over the past five months. Now we're talking big numbers."

After a few years in which these funds outstripped most other types of bond funds, they have recently fallen hard, in step with the stock market. Some other bond funds, by contrast, have eked out recent gains that partly offset investors' stock-market pain.
The recent performance of junk bonds shouldn't be any surprise to investors familiar with the odd hybrid nature of below-investment-grade bonds. ""Sometimes these securities trade with the general bond market and sometimes they trade with the stock market,"" says Earl McEvoy, manager of Vanguard Fixed-Income Securities High-Yield Fund. Lately, it's been much closer to the stock market.
But ""too often,"" Mr. McEvoy says, investors assume a high-yield fund is simply that -- ""just another bond fund with a higher yield."" In a period like the past several weeks -- when stock prices tumbled but government-bond prices rose -- he says investors may assume mistakenly that their junk-bond funds are comfortably holding their ground.
That certainly hasn't been the case. Since the stock-market peak on July 17, Lipper Analytical Services Inc.'s high-yield fund index has posted a negative 9.0% return. That's not as bad as the performance of most stock funds, such as the 15.7% decline for the Lipper Growth Fund Index.

842614934,u.s.-economy-slowing-down?-cut-taxes.,wsj_398625922,1998-07-22,"The U.S. economy has hit a bump. In the first quarter of 1998 it grew at an annualized rate of 5.4%. The final second quarter numbers aren't in yet, but it appears the economy contracted by as much as 1% or 2%. Even granting that the first-quarter figures were buoyed with inventory accumulation that was worked off in the second quarter, this reversal of fortunes is remarkable.
Asia is the culprit. The continent is in an economic tailspin. Japan has had virtually no growth for six or seven years and is now officially in a recession. South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia are all in serious trouble brought on by corruption, cronyism and fraud. Curiously, China remains relatively stable because it avoided the excesses of debt that ultimately ruined the other Asian economies.
Why does this matter to us? The Commerce Department reported that the U.S. trade deficit hit a record of $15.7 billion in May. As President Clinton noted at a news conference last Friday, ""almost the entire increase in the trade deficit is due to the Asian economic troubles."" The higher deficit may not matter much in the long run but in the short-term it forces U.S. companies to make costly production adjustments. Firms that manufacture widgets, both for export and to compete against foreign-made widgets in the U.S., will find themselves temporarily overstocked and will have to decrease production accordingly.
The trade deficit is likely to keep growing. If experience is any guide, many Asian businesses will do anything to keep their plants open, including dumping goods by selling at below market price in any market that can absorb them. Perhaps the only reason we haven't seen this dumping yet is that, because the Asian crises originated in their financial markets, export financing has been hard to come by.
International trade has boosted the U.S. economy for years, but now it is an economic drag and will remain so for some time to come. As Asian economies falter, foreign demand for U.S. goods and services falls. And as imports rise, U.S. companies find the competition tougher at home."

Since May of 2003, U.S. businesses have created 5.2 million new jobs. The highly publicized layoffs of 50,000 workers by Ford and General Motors over the next two years is the number of net new jobs the U.S. economy is producing every week in other industries.
In such high-growth regions as the Southeast and Mountain West, the problem is a shortage of willing and trained workers. Thank goodness for immigrant workers who are filling vital niches in the labor force. Critics continue to complain that President Bush's tax policies have only benefited the super-wealthy, but that would come as news to the five million Americans who were jobless before the 2003 tax cuts, and thus had no income, but now have a weekly paycheck.
Employers are on enough of a hiring spree that some Wall Street economists of the Keynesian persuasion are fretting over wage-push inflationary pressures. Inflationary pressures do exist due to a Federal Reserve policy of excess dollar liquidity, as evidenced by the $600 price of gold futures. But this is a problem for monetary policy. More people working increases the supply of goods and services, which forces prices down, not up.
Since at least February of 2004, wages have been rising at a slightly faster pace than core inflation, and the median wage has climbed to more than $600 a week for the first time ever. These pay hikes are a result of another hallmark of this expansion: rapid productivity growth, particularly in manufacturing. So workers are benefiting from a labor market trifecta: robust expansion in jobs, steady gains in productivity and gains in real take-home pay.
This employment boom once again stands in contrast to the jobs depression in France. Thanks to much more flexible work rules, ease of hiring and firing, lower government benefits for not working, and lower taxes on employers (29.6% of employer costs in the U.S. versus 47.4% in France), more than half of America's 15-to-24-year-olds have jobs, versus only about one-in-four in France."

Michigan, facing its lowest unemployment rate in almost 30 years, at 4.4%, is doing the once unimaginable.

One private company alone says it has about 1,000 openings.
On behalf of hundreds of companies looking for skilled workers ranging from engineers and computer analysts to construction workers, the five-week campaign is essentially a huge help-wanted ad for the state. The ad, touted by Gov. John Engler's administration as proof of Michigan's economic comeback, comes complete with a list of fringe benefits, including affordable housing, 11,000 inland lakes and the nation's highest number of golf courses. Likely to be added soon: ""Home of the Stanley Cup Champions,"" after Detroit's beloved Red Wings won the title Saturday night.

Businesses in Ohio are touting job openings, symphony, and ballet in national magazines like BYTE, and are flooding the nation's job fairs with glossy brochures in a campaign already exceeding $20,000.

830983376,bad-news-poverty-figures,wapo_307191873,1989-10-22,"THE POLITICIANS pay too little attention; the 1988 income and poverty figures just issued by the Census Bureau are bad news.
The longest sustained economic expansion in peacetime history has failed to drive the poverty rate back to the lows of the 1970s; the economy famous for lifting all boats no longer does so. Real per capita income was up, but this broadest measure of economic well-being is an average. As in other recent years, for the richest two-fifths of families median income and income share rose; for the poorest two-fifths they declined. The gap between rich and poor was the highest in the 40-odd years it has been measured.
The poverty rate was 13.1 percent, more than one American in eight, down only 0.3 percent from the year before. The bureau called that steady. For children, who made up 40 percent of the poor, the rate was 19.7 percent, the highest of any age group; for blacks, 31.6 percent; black children, 44.6 percent; Hispanics and Hispanic children, 26.8 percent and 37.9 percent. For the elderly it was 12 percent, lower than for the population as a whole.
Weak wages are one of the reasons the economy no longer functions as it used to. In real terms the earnings of men working full-time year-round declined last year, while those of women were flat. Median family income was also flat for the first time since the recovery began in 1982. When married couples gain ground, it is often because both wife and husband work, but not even steady work is enough to save all families. A sixth of poor families last year were headed by people, mostly men, who worked full-time year-round.
The policy implications of these figures are as obvious as they are resisted. The need is not to cut the capital gains tax, but to raise the minimum wage, to liberalize the earned-income tax credit for the working poor with children, and perhaps also to make the existing child care credit refundable and available to those too poor to owe any taxes. All four of these proposals are before Congress. Rejecting the first while enacting the others would move money from people who most emphatically do not need it to others who do."

Analysts said the figures show, yet again, that inflation is well under control despite a noticeably improving economy.
Last month's steady prices followed a moderate increase in December, when prices were 0.2% above November's. The bitterly cold weather didn't damage crops enough to force up prices, as the cost of food declined last month. Clothing, trans portation and energy prices declined as well, while housing prices moderated. Medical-care and entertainment prices both rose 0.3%, the same as they did in December. The so-called core rate of inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy sectors, was up only 0.1%, com pared with a 0.2% rise in December.
January's consumer price report marks the first in which the Labor Department has used new seasonal adjustments to help diminish the report's tendency to show larger price increases at the beginning of the year and smaller ones at the end.
For that reason, analysts were unsure how much credence to put into the January price figures. ""I don't believe the headline should read 'inflation is dead,' but if I saw no change at all in February and March, I would consider it a real trend,"" said Kathryn Kobe, economist for Joel Popkin & Co. in Washington."

Although $100 billion of Treasury securities are bought and sold daily on Wall Street, making the Treasury bond market by far the single biggest securities market in the world, most bond traders can't make any money.
The problem: Too many bond dealers chasing too few customers have squeezed profit margins to the bare bones. Ten years ago, a dealer typically could expect to make a $1,250 profit on a $1 million trade of Treasury notes, said Richard M. Kelly, president of bond dealer Aubrey G. Lanston & Co. Now, that profit has shrunk to just $312.50, he said.
Nowhere is the suffering worse than at the nation's primary dealers, an elite group of big commercial banks and brokerage firms that buy and sell government bonds directly with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as it executes monetary policy. They also are required to step up and buy bonds at every Treasury auction of government securities; the dealers try to quickly resell the securities.

Consumer credit increased a seasonally adjusted $7.11 billion in July, the board said, after rising $7.83 billion in June and a record $10.23 billion in May.
Alan Murray, vice president of Citicorp Information Services, said the July figures show that ""consumer demand remains strong,"" despite other signs that the vigorous economic recovery may be slowing. He said the continued heavy borrowing suggests that consumer spending isn't about to decline precipitously, as some consumer-goods producers had feared.
Still, Mr. Murray doesn't expect such unusually strong growth in consumer credit to continue. ""With increases like these,"" he said, ""sooner or later, the consumer has to run out of gas.""
The Fed report showed that consumer credit grew at a 19.75% annual rate in July, compared with an average annual pace of 24% during the second quarter and 11.5% for all of 1983.

The U.S. intervention in currency markets occurred yesterday morning, when the Federal Reserve sold a small amount of dollars in exchange for West German marks. The move helped slow the rally that has carried the dollar sharply higher in the past week.
U.S. officials indicated that the Fed's action was intended as a show of support for the West German central bank, whose leaders fear further increases in the dollar could boost inflation in their country.
But U.S. officials remain generally satisfied with the recent rise in the dollar. At the Fed, in particular, it is seen as a sign that foreign investors are growing convinced of the central bank's determination to fight inflation. Fed officials have no intention, for now, of undertaking large-scale intervention to stop the dollar's ascent.
New York currency dealers described yesterday's intervention as modest.

That was significantly higher than last year's April deficit of $20 billion and above the $30 billion deficit that private-sector economists had expected.
The government generally runs surpluses in April, as millions of taxpayers file their income tax returns. But income tax payments were down this April, reflecting the impact of the recession, which has pushed millions of people out of work.
The Obama administration forecast in February that the deficit for this year would hit $1.56 trillion, surpassing the record of $1.4 trillion set last year. Many private-sector economists think that this year's imbalance will be closer to the $1.4 trillion set last year and that deficits will remain high for years to come.
The trillion-dollar-plus deficits are being driven by the effects of the recession, which has cut government tax revenue while driving up spending.
Analysts estimate that roughly one-third of the increase in deficits over the past two years can be attributed to lost revenue -- the result of fewer people working and lower corporate profits. Another third was from increased government spending that normally occurs in a downturn, such as higher payments for unemployment benefits and food stamps. The final third reflects added government spending on the $787 billion stimulus bill and the $700 billion financial bailout."

The jobless nature of the recovery is particularly unsettling. In June, the government's Household Survey reported that since the start of the year, the number of people with jobs increased by 753,000 -- but there are jobs and then there are ""jobs.""

That's just for starters. The survey includes part-time workers who want full-time work but can't get it, as well as those who want to work but have stopped looking. That puts the real unemployment rate for June at 14.3%, up from 13.8% in May.
The 7.6% unemployment figure so common in headlines these days is utterly misleading. An estimated 22 million Americans are unemployed or underemployed; they are virtually invisible and mostly excluded from unemployment calculations that garner headlines.
At this stage of an expansion you would expect the number of part-time jobs to be declining, as companies would be doing more full-time hiring. Not this time.

""But that attitude can also be an excuse for sidestepping life's most important questions.""
On May 19, Bush was asked about a plan by his Democratic opponent, Sen. John F. Kerry (Mass.), to halt shipments that are replenishing emergency petroleum reserves. Bush replied by saying we should not empty the reserves -- something nobody in a responsible position has proposed. ""The idea of emptying the Strategic Petroleum Reserve would put America in a dangerous position in the war on terror,"" Bush said. ""We're at war.""
The president has used a similar technique on the stump, when explaining his decision to go to war in Iraq in light of the subsequent failure to find stockpiles of forbidden weapons. In the typical speech, Bush explains the prewar intelligence indicating Saddam Hussein had such weapons, and then presents in inarguable conclusion: ""So I had a choice to make: either trust the word of a madman, or defend America. Given that choice, I will defend America every time.""
Missing from that equation is the actual choice Bush confronted: support continued U.N. weapons inspections, or go to war."

The result is that when the figures are all counted, the deficit for fiscal 1992, which ended Sept. 30, should turn out to be about $290 billion. While that would be a record, exceeding the previous year's $269 billion deficit, it's far below the $368 billion that the Congressional Budget Office originally had forecast. The White House budget office once had assumed that the gap would be even greater: a mammoth $399 billion.
Still, analysts say the surprising improvement for 1992 could prove to be short-lived, and they expect enormous deficits for the foreseeable future.
Last summer, the CBO and White House pared their deficit projections to $314 billion and $334 billion, respectively -- mostly to reflect delays in deposit-insurance spending for the savings-and-loan cleanup.
But in the short time since those revisions were made, the government has taken in more revenue than it thought it would, while spending has been somewhat less. The precise reason is unclear. Yet government budget officials say that, among other things, a surprising number of estimated tax payments have been rolling in."

It was the fourth straight year of strong profit gains among companies ranked in Fortuneâ€™s annual listing, released today. The surge in profitâ€”to nearly $300 billion for the 500 companiesâ€”was in percentage terms far greater than worker income gains and other measures of economic health.
The profit growth is widely viewed as an unsustainable trend that already has begun to show signs of faltering, partly reflected in the recent pullback in the roaring stock market.
Investors are increasingly concerned that the Federal Reserve has only started to nudge interest rates upward, which raises the cost of doing business and discourages people from spending money.

Inflation is rising. Yesterday the Labor Department said consumer prices in the U.S. jumped 0.4% in January and are up 4.3% over the past 12 months, near a 16-year high. Even stripping out sharply rising food and energy costs, prices rose 0.3% in January, driven by education, medical care, clothing and hotels. They are up by 2.5% from the previous year, a 10-month high.
The same day brought a reminder of possible recession. The Federal Reserve disclosed that its policy makers lowered their forecast for economic growth this year to between 1.3% and 2%, half a percentage point below the level of their previous forecast, in October. They blamed a further slowdown on the slump in housing prices, tighter lending standards and higher oil prices. They warned the economy's performance could fall short of even that lowered outlook.
Stocks fell on the Labor Department's morning inflation report. But shares rallied after the afternoon release of the minutes of the Jan. 29-30 meeting of Fed policy makers and their latest forecast for the economy. That's because investors took the Fed's darker outlook on growth to mean that it intended to cut its short-term interest rate next month at its next scheduled meeting.

But 75,000 of the new jobs came from federally funded summer jobs for teenagers. While those jobs may have helped to lower the unemployment rate of teen-agers by 2.6 percentage points, it did hardly anything to help adults, who are the driving force behind consumer spending.
But there is also a positive spin to the job growth. With such a slow economy, any job-creation is good. Aside from the growth in government positions, the service sector added 110,000 jobs in July, following a meager increase in June.

Just hours after watching Iraqis clamber on a fallen statue of Saddam Hussein, Mr. Bush brainstormed yesterday with Chief of Staff Andrew Card and legislative liaison David Hobbs to figure out a way to salvage his $725 billion tax-cut package, under siege on Capitol Hill.

Mr. Bush still faces big challenges in Iraq. They include the prospect of continued sporadic fighting and casualties, and the complicated task of overseeing humanitarian relief and reconstruction in Iraq. The White House's insistence on taking the lead in rebuilding Iraq could undermine the very government they help create and further alienate European allies, whose financial assistance will be critical to a process some estimate could cost an annual $25 billion for many years to come.

830982233,what-we-could-learn-from-mexico,wapo_307374234,1990-11-21,"The sad spectacle of the U.S. political leadership's fruitless negotiations over the past several months - or is it years now? - to reduce the country's increasingly hard-to-finance budget deficit has prompted some observers to talk about the ""Latinamericanization"" of the U.S. economy. They refer, presumably, to Latin America's unhappy experience for almost a decade with huge external debt, large budget deficits fueled by too much spending and too few taxes, and closed economies protecting inefficient local industry. Indeed, this characterization of the U.S. economy seems uncomfortably apt.
However, at least one Latin American country stands out as a model of economic modernization, and the United States would do well to emulate its commitment to budget and tax reform. Mexico - yes, Mexico - has demonstrated greater courage, foresight and political will to tackle its economic problems than has its more powerful neighbor to the north. And it is now beginning to enjoy the fruits of those endeavors.
Obviously the countries are vastly different in terms of their economic power. Nevertheless, they share startlingly similar problems, which Mexico has done a better job of solving. After a long spending spree, Mexico's budget deficit soared to 18 percent of gross domestic product by 1982. Through a combination of gut-wrenching cuts in spending and far-reaching tax reform, Mexico's budget today is essentially in balance. Mexico delights in pointing out, accurately, that it has put into effect the equivalent of three Gramm-Rudmans. Would that our government could achieve even one.
The United States runs chronic trade deficits, and protectionist sentiment, especially in Congress, is strong. The most recent manifestation, coming on the heels of many others, is the textile bill. Though vetoed by the president, it reflects a political consensus in this country that certain sectors, both industrial and agricultural, still need to be protected. Compared with a decade ago, restraints on U.S. imports have doubled. At least 20 percent of U.S. imports are limited by some form of non-tariff barrier, thus not only depriving the consumer of cheaper imports but also subsidizing noncompetitive industry.
Mexico, on the other hand, has dramatically reduced import barriers, transforming itself from one of the most closed economies in the world to one of the most open. Non-oil exports have quadrupled, and Mexico has become a world-class producer of automobiles, automotive parts, televisions, computer chips and satellite and aircraft components."

The best news the market could get, Mr. Metz says, would be more evidence that the Federal Reserve's credit-tightening moves are beginning to slow the economy. Last week's declines in the index of leading economic indicators and in home sales were encouraging from this point of view, he says, as was Friday's announcement of a relatively modest rise in non-farm payrolls in August.
That news sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average on a giddy rise of more than 50 points. But investors may need to be shown more. Friday's volume, after subtracting a big dividend-capture trade, was only moderate at around 150 million shares."

Even if rates do rise, that probably won't stop the six-year-old economic expansion anytime soon, analysts say. Most economists in several recent surveys predicted continued economic growth for at least another six months to a year. But investors may react to rising rates by selling stocks and long-term bonds.
A surge in short-term rates over the past three weeks already has prompted many investors to switch their funds into such short-term investments as six-month Treasury bills, which now yield more than 8 1/2%. That's only about 2/3 of a percentage point below 30-year Treasury bondsand it's nearly five percentage points higher than the dividend yield on the 500 stocks in the Standard & Poor's Corp. index.

While a shift toward van and light-truck production accounts for some of the drop in car assembly, the factory schedules nonetheless indicate that the economy's ""soft landing"" hasn't yet erased fears of a slump in Detroit. ""The other side of a soft landing is a soft recovery,"" said Mary Ann Keller, an auto industry analyst with Furman Selz Mager Dietz & Birney in New York. ""We haven't created the pent-up demand,"" necessary for a sales boom, she added.
The Big Three's cautious year-end production plans sharply contrast with the aggressive production schedules they set and mostly kept earlier this year, despite criticism by analysts that those schedules were unwarranted. Meanwhile, foreign-based U.S. auto makers are continuing their trend of boosting car production.
The U.S. operations of Japanese auto makers continue to account for a growing portion of U.S. car production. Plants owned by foreign auto makers or operated as joint ventures with U.S. companies plan to build 312,609 cars in the fourth quarter, or 18.3% of the total, up from 205,875 cars, or 10.9% of the total a year ago.
Overbuilding earlier in the year caused auto makers to trim their bulging inventories of vehicles by sponsoring aggressive sales promotions, including cash rebates to consumers. That helped reduce inventories but, analysts say, it also prompted consumers who were considering purchasing later in the year to do so before then. The effect will be fewer car and truck sales in the coming months. Consumers also will be slow to purchase the 1990 models because some of the models carry the sharpest price rises in recent years."

The labor market improved last week, with the second-lowest number of initial jobless claims in three years.
Retail sales rose 0.5 percent from the previous month to $325 billion after a revised 1.2 percent increase in November, which was the highest since July, the Commerce Department said. Consumer prices edged up 0.2 percent in December, capping a year in which costs excluding food and energy rose by 1.1 percent, the smallest increase in 43 years.
Increased demand has encouraged companies to keep more workers, helping push initial jobless claims down 11,000, to 343,000, last week. Since the recovery began in November 2001, the economy has shed 1.1 million jobs.
""What all this shows is that the economy is doing quite well and we're heading for a sizable amount of job creation,"" said Lyle E. Gramley, a former Federal Reserve governor who is now senior economic adviser at Charles Schwab Capital Markets LP in Washington. ""I wouldn't be surprised if it turns out that job growth has been substantially more than has been reported.""

This is true even in the stock market which has been propelled upwards as interest rates have plummeted. And the municipal market set records in 1985 with a total outpouring of $205 billion of new securities.
As it looks now, 1986 is going to be the year of the corporate bond. In 1985, corporate bond issuance totaled a record $75.6 billion. Unofficially, through the first six months of 1986, $80.5 billion of new corporates have been marketed.
With the new issue calendar averaging $3.8 billion of corporates each week, the marketplace literally has been deluged.
In order to market these new bonds, a new issue is priced at a yield spread off of a Treasury issue with a similar maturity. For example, in early January, a 30-year AA public utility bond was priced to offer 120 basis points more yield than the 30-year Treasury.
As the new issue primary market continued to grow, the secondary market languished. What developed was a two-tier corporate bond market as buyers of the new issues sold their old bonds into the secondary market to pay for the new bonds. Consequently, the dealers have been unable to move the older bonds and they are loaded with inventory while the yields on these seasoned bonds have continued to rise.

842614104,year-end-review-of-bond-markets:-junk-bond-defaults-expected-to-multiply------staff-reporter-of-the-wall-street-journal-by-constance-mitchell,wsj_398288804,1991-01-02,"NEW YORK -- Junk-bond investors were buried under an avalanche of corporate defaults in 1990. And according to analysts, the worst is yet to come.
""Defaults will not slow down,"" said Mark Backman, a senior vice president at Standard & Poor's Corp., the credit-rating concern. ""There still are many highly leveraged companies that are close to or on the verge of defaulting,"" he said.
There are a number of trends working against heavily indebted companies, the group of firms considered the most likely candidates to default on bond payments. All of the companies that defaulted during 1990 had debt ratings that were below investment grade, a category often referred to as ""junk."" No company with an investment-grade rating defaulted.
Many analysts blame the economic recession for the rise in defaults in the past year. And as the business downturn deepens, making it difficult for companies to meet debt payments as their revenue dwindles, the analysts expect junk-bond defaults to multiply.
The junk-bond market has shriveled, with only $1.4 billion of new junk-bond issues during 1990. And the reluctance of banks to continue to finance marginal companies has left these companies with scant room to maneuver."

The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods-considered to be items that will last at least three years-totaled $125.23 billion last month, $10.14 billion higher than the May total.
The June increase, which followed a 1.9 percent decline in May, was the biggest advance since an 8.9 percent jump in December 1985. It provided further evidence of the strength in U.S. manufacturing, analysts said.
""Stripping the fluff away, we are still left with a strong pace of activity in the durable goods sector,"" said Allen Sinai, chief economist of The Boston Co.
U.S. manufacturing was in a virtual recession for two years beginning in mid-1984 as the soaring value of the dollar attracted a flood of imports into the country and made American goods uncompetitive on overseas markets."
842615043,trade-gap-widened-to-$10.29-billion-during-january-as-imports-surged,wsj_397930065,1985-03-01,"WASHINGTON -- Surging imports from Europe and Japan caused the U.S. trade deficit to widen to $10.29 billion in January from $8.03 billion the previous month, the Commerce Department said.
The widening in January came despite a 3.3% decline in the value of petroleum imports, which are often volatile. Total imports rose 9.2%.
The large January deficit makes it clear that the easing of the nation's trade problems at the end of last year was temporary, reflecting a slowdown in imports as a result of sluggish economic growth in the third quarter.
Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said the 10% rise in the value of the dollar last year, plus the 9% jump since December, could push the deficit to a record $140 billion this year. The trade deficit in 1984 was a record $123.31 billion, compared with $69.39 billion in 1983, the previous record.
A strong dollar can widen the trade deficit by lowering the cost of imports to U.S. buyers and raising the cost of exports to foreign buyers. The problem is exacerbated by strong economic growth in this country, which encourages the purchase of foreign goods, and relatively sluggish growth overseas, which discourages purchases of U.S. products."

Foreign investors increased purchases of U.S. securities in June for the first time in five months, evidence foreign demand is ample to sufficiently finance the U.S. current-account deficit.
Foreigners bought $71.8 billion in U.S. stocks and bonds in June, up from $65.2 billion in May, according to the Treasury Department. Analysts estimate $45 billion to $50 billion in foreign investment is needed each month to finance the U.S. current-account gap, the broadest gauge of the nation's global trade. It stood at a record $144.9 billion in the first quarter.
So far this year, foreign net purchases of U.S. securities are averaging around $75 billion a month, up from about $50 billion a month last year, analysts say. ""Worries about the ability of the U.S. to finance its twin deficits -- the current-account deficit and budget deficit -- remain overblown,"" said Tony Crescenzi, chief bond-market strategist at Miller Tabak.
The June foreign-investment data exceeded financial markets' expectations that net purchases would be between $50 billion and $60 billion. ""The dollar had a positive reaction simply because the number was better than most people expected,"" said Shahab Jalinoos, senior foreign-exchange strategist at ABN-AMRO."

Rates on 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds reached 7.26 percent, more than a full percentage point above their level at the beginning of February when bond prices started their tumble.
Bond investors and traders took the report as a sign the economy is growing so fast that it will cause inflation to worsen and prompt the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates significantly. To protect themselves against those possibilities, investors demanded higher rates before they would commit their money.
Some analysts said they expected yesterdayâ€™s rise in interest rates to trigger another large sell-off when the stock market, which was closed yesterday in observance of Good Friday, opens Monday.
Yesterdayâ€™s bond market decline again illustrates how news of a strengthening economy can rattle financial markets already in a bearish mood. That is largely because investors and traders fear that strong economic growth will lead to higher inflation and interest ratesâ€”two things that invariably unsettle markets. [See story, Page D12.)"
