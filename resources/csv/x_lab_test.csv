' Federal Reserve Board Governor Henry C. Wallich yesterday rejected t he view held by the monetarist school that strict adherence by the Fed to pre-announced money supply targets ?would lead to stabler and ultimately jower interest rates.â€ù ' In a speech in Bethesda to the Robert Morris Associates, Wallich said that it 'may seem plausible that interest rates in the long run would be lower under such tight control of monetary aggregates â€œthan a procedure that accepts temporary over- and under-shoots.â€ù
But in the short run, â€œMonetary restraint, however steady, cannot quickly bringdown inflation nor interest rates,â€ù the Fed governor asserted. â€œThe most plausible view is that the main impact of monetary restraint on prices occurs ivith a two-year lag.â€ù 'â€¢ The Federal Reserve has been widely criticized this year for permitting exceedingly wide fluctuations in both interest rates and in the monetary aggregates. Influential advisers to the incoming Reagan administration, including economists Milton Friedman and Murray Weidenhaum, have joined in the policy critique.
* In addition, there have been background comments implying that pressure would l>e brought to bear on the Fed to adhere more strictly to its announced monetary targets. The Fed has not commented directly on such suggestions, hut Wallichâ€™s comments clearly constituted his own rebuttal of that line of thinking.
He conceded that the ups and downs of both interest rates and the supply aggregates had been wide this year, but blamed â€œthe sad record of the monetary aggregatesâ€ù on rapidly shifting demand for money and credit, combined with the imposition and then the removal of credit controls."

The action is expected to push down the closely watched federal funds rate, at which banks lend to each other, 1/4 percentage point to about 8 1/4%.
Other short-term interest rates are likely to drop as well. Most banks' prime lending rate, which remained at 10 1/2% after the Fed eased earlier this month, could begin falling as early as today.
The move touched off modest rallies in stocks and bonds Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining 17.49 points to 2656.78 in pre-holiday trading.
Government officials indicated that the timing of the Fed move, so soon after the previous one, reflects the degree of concern at the Fed about the slowing of the economy, most notably the manufacturing sector. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan follows that sector with particular interest."

However, loan applicants of all races throughout the area were less likely to be denied credit than were applicants in the country as a whole, the Fed reported.
â€œWe're severely disappointed in the new numbers,â€ù said John Taylor, president and chief executive of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, a District-based group that monitors lending in poor communities. Banks have said for at least two years that they are stepping up minority lending, Taylor said, and ""this was the year that we should have seen an appreciable difference.â€ù
In the metropolitan area, which includes several Maryland counties and extends south to Prince William County, 14.2 percent of blacks and 9.4 percent of Hispanics were denied mortgages, compared with 5 percent of whites. Lending rates for individual institutions were not disclosed.
Stephen S. Fuller, a George Mason University professor who writes a monthly report on the Washington area economy, said the difference in denial rates is ""partly explained by educational level, and that educational level affects the income, or career, or job type that a population seems to be characterized by."" â€œItâ€™s very dangerous to generalize like this,â€ù â€¢ Fuller added, but ""there are some legitimate reasons for these differences. . .. The question is, are those [reasons] sufficient to explain the magnitude of the differences described, and the answer is no,â€ù he said."

The stock market, which moved upward last year mainly because of lower interest rates, now seems to be focusing mainly on an expectation of better corporate earnings. Meanwhile, the dollar is showing new weakness, the budget deficit isn't sinking very much, and a revival of inflation begins to look like a realistic possibility.
That's more or less the situation the Federal Open Market Committee will confront next month as it meets to plan monetary policy for 1987. What will the committee decide to do?
It may not matter very much. Last February the FOMC decided that M1, the narrowly defined money supply, should grow at a rate between 3% and 8% in 1987. In July the committee reaffirmed that range but also said that growth in excess of 3% to 8% would be ""acceptable."" It's a good thing the committee left itself some leeway, since the actual growth rate was about 17%.
But the committee, whose voting members are the Federal Reserve governors and five of the regional Reserve Bank presidents, is required by law to say something. Composing the statement will be a little more difficult than usual this time, since the Fed seems to have gotten itself into a box.
Through last year the Federal Reserve was under pressure from the Reagan administration to force interest rates lower, depreciate the dollar and stimulate economic growth. Chairman Paul Volcker made occasional noises to the effect that a falling dollar could be inflationary, but by and large the Fed went along. After all, the consumer price index last year rose at an annual rate of 1.1%, so why worry about inflation?"

Producer prices fell a seasonally adjusted 1.9% in December from the previous month, the Labor Department said, led by lower energy prices. It marks the fifth-straight monthly decline and a stunning reversal in just a few short months from the price pressures seen in mid-2008.
The lower prices bring some much-needed relief to hard-pressed businesses as the U.S. recession marches on -- but they also reflect weakness in global demand for goods. Manufacturing activity is down sharply in the world's biggest economies, including the U.S., Japan and Europe; it also has slowed in markets like China that once had enormous demand for raw materials. U.S. producer prices in December were down 0.9% from the previous year, the biggest yearly drop since 2001.
Energy prices fell 9.3% last month from November, as wholesale gasoline prices tumbled 25.7%. Food prices declined 1.5%. The declines are expected to be passed on to consumers, as businesses work to attract customers through heavy discounting. The Labor Department will release its December consumer prices on Friday.
Excluding food and energy, core producer prices held up last month, rising 0.2% from November and 4.3% from the previous year -- the largest annual gain in two decades. But core prices are expected to decline in the months ahead, which, combined with falling wages, is stoking concerns about a looming downward spiral of lower prices and spending known as deflation."

Stocks rose, along with bond prices, after Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee that the economy has hit a ""soft patch"" but should grow moderately over the long term.

Talk about money for nothing.
Late last month, the U.S. Treasury issued debt at a record-low yield to maturity of negative 1.286% over nearly five years. Of course, there was a catch: The government also is obligated to compensate the holder of the instrument, a Treasury inflation-protected security, for any change in the consumer-price index between now and when it matures.
The buyers of the TIPS were betting on inflation of at least 2% to earn the break-even return -- the amount that would at least equal the 0.71% they could have received on an ordinary five-year Treasury the same day. That is well above the 1.4% year-on-year gain in the consumer-price index reported for July, or the 1.5% gain for August expected on Friday.
And the amount that investors have been willing to pay has risen noticeably. Ever since talk heated up that the Federal Reserve will engage in a third round of bond buying, implied bets on inflation have, too. The 10-year break-even rate has risen to 2.376% currently from 2% in late July."

Talk persists that a recession is brewing, very possibly arriving within the year. Yet, at the same time, signs mount that the economy is reasonably robust, with brisk gains in employment, capital spending and exports leading the way to new highs in overall business activity.
The juxtaposition may seem peculiar, to say the least, but there's really nothing very odd about it. Recessions normally do arrive on the heels of relatively robust economic activity, not when business is stagnating. This is because, in a sustained upswing, a burgeoning economy eventually comes up against barriers -- financial as well as physical -- to further growth. A recession perforce ensues.
How close to such a barrier point is the economy now?
Closer, perhaps, than is widely recognized."

But as economists read through the Federal Open Market Committee statement on the move, bond prices began to slump, especially among shorter-term issues.
Some economists noted that not only did the Fed increase the federal funds rate by 0.50%, but also the discount rate by the same margin. The fed funds rate is the bank overnight lending rate and the discount rate is the rate the Fed charges from its discount window. In addition to the rate boosts, the Fed termed signs of slowing as ""tentative"" and hinted that the economy remains quite vigorous, even as it raised rates for the seventh time in about one year.

The reality is that the Great Recession ended three long years ago. In this Less Than Great Recovery, the economy shows promise for one good quarter then slows back down.

The stock market rose as investors bet that the lousy growth will inspire more Federal Reserve easing.
The sliver of good news is that private growth, which is what really matters, was up a slightly less anemic 1.8%, and government spending fell by a minus-1.4% from the first quarter. Housing is also now less of a drag on GDP. But this makes the paltry 1.5% growth more disconcerting, because it means that other parts of the economy are growing less rapidly than they ought to be.
Consumption ticked up only 1.5%, for example, down from 2.4% in the first quarter. This may reflect that wages and salaries are barely keeping pace with inflation. Another negative is that business inventories climbed unexpectedly in the second quarter, which often presages a decline in business spending in the next quarter to clear the shelves."

With the Fed set to push up interest rates for the first time in over four years today, one little fact may have eluded many investors: The economy's growth rate already seems to be slowing down.
Start with consumer spending. When the Commerce Department released May spending figures Monday, it revised down its read on real personal consumption in April. This came hand in hand with warnings of slower June sales from General Motors, Wal-Mart Stores and Target, which account for about one-tenth of U.S. retail sales.

To show the dimensions of these investments, principally American, between October 1955 and March 1957, net direct investments amounted to Canadian S639 million; net new security issues amounted to Canadian $701 million; trade in outstanding securities amounted to Canadian $300 million; other capital flows amounted to Canadian $390 million. Also, Canada increased its official holdings of gold and U. S. dollars by Canadian $16 million.
Canada, which resembles the movement of European money into the United States subsequent to the Civil War, came from the United States.

The tax reductions for 1953-54 consisted mainly in eliminating a surchaiâ€™ge' on individual income taxes and a reduction in the corporate profits tax. Similar but small reductions characterized the rate changes for 1955-56, introduced when the extent and timing of the economic recovery was still unknown. For 1957-58, there were smaller cuts in indirect taxes, reducing aggregate tax revenues by about 1 per cent and still leaving an increased budget surplus.â€ù"

Thousands of workers using shovels were building a canal. Friedman was puzzled. Why weren't there any excavators or any mechanized earth-moving equipment? A government official explained that using shovels created more jobs. Friedman's response: ""Then why not use spoons instead of shovels?""
That story came to mind last week when President Obama linked technology to job losses. ""There are some structural issues with our economy where a lot of businesses have learned to become much more efficient with a lot fewer workers,"" he said. ""You see it when you go to a bank and you use an ATM, you don't go to a bank teller, or you go to the airport and you're using a kiosk instead of checking in at the gate.""
The president calls this a structural issue--we usually call it progress. And it isn't exactly a new phenomenon. It's been going on for centuries, and its pace has accelerated over the past 50 years. Businesses relentlessly look for ways to replace workers with machines. The machines get better and smarter. We go from spoons to shovels to excavators, not the other way around.

With results from about 271 of companies in the index already in, first-quarter earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are now on track for a gain of 3.6% versus a year ago, according to S&P Capital IQ. That isn't very strong, but it is much better than the 0.5% that analysts were looking for at the start of this month. And given that about half the companies in the index have yet to report, and that they, too, will likely top estimates, actual earnings growth will likely be higher still.
Sales-growth figures, on the other hand, have been going the other way. As of Friday, S&P 500 revenue was on track for a gain of 1.4% versus a year ago. At the beginning of the month, that gain was pegged at 4%. Another sign of the divide between what's happening to the top and bottom lines: Only 43% of companies have topped revenue estimates thus far, compared with 70% for earnings.
The decline in revenue-growth expectations isn't as bad as it seems at first blush, however. Much of it is concentrated in the energy and basic materials sectors, and reflects a decline in commodity prices that is helping drive down costs to other companies, as well as consumers.
And once again, the overall weakness in revenue seems concentrated in companies' foreign, rather than domestic, operations. Some evidence for that: Friday's gross domestic product report for the U.S. showed that final sales to domestic purchasers were up 3% in the first quarter. Since large public companies, if anything, tend to generate better sales growth than the overall economy is experiencing, it is pretty clear that overseas sales are the real weak spot."

The president met yesterday with 10 business leaders as part of an evolving effort to show concern about the state of the economy. In addition to the hour-long meeting, Mr. Bush presided over a cabinet meeting where he heard several presentations on the economy.
Today he is scheduled to hear again from his economic advisers to discuss ways of easing tight credit conditions, the third such meeting he has held in the past two weeks.
The business leaders, who were mostly chairmen of Fortune 500 companies, had differing views of the economy's health, according to Robert Giordano, a Goldman, Sachs & Co. economist who attended. But they were largely unanimous in urging the president to oppose measures that increase business costs -- such as legislation mandating health benefits -- and to push measures that reduce those costs -- such as limits on product liability suits.

They sometimes look past food-price increases that appear temporary or isolated while trying to control broad and long-term inflation trends, not blips that might soon reverse.
The Federal Reserve faces an especially important challenge now as it mulls the long-standing dilemma of what to make of the price of a pork chop.
As Fed officials debate when to start raising short-term interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating and causing inflation, Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen has signaled she wants to take her time.
Broad measures of inflation have been running below the Fed's 2% target for more than two years, but show signs of picking up.

A few months ago, the Fed seemed to be on cruise control as the economy healed. Many officials at the central bank hoped they were done with launching complicated programs to spur a sluggish economy. But Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues, once again disappointed by slow growth and small employment gains this year, are formulating another dose of monetary stimulus to be considered at their next policy meeting in mid-September.
So when the chairman speaks Friday morning at the central bank's annual retreat here, he must once again address whether there is more the Fed can do to get the economy going and whether it is worth taking chances on controversial new programs. All along he has argued these efforts are worth it and appears likely to stick to that line in his speech.
Beyond big issues of the moment -- such as whether the Fed will launch a new bond-buying program -- a broader question looms in Jackson Hole about Mr. Bernanke's legacy. Long after his term as chairman ends in 17 months, will he be remembered as the Fed chief who did too little to combat high unemployment or the one who did too much and unleashed inflation and financial instability with the actions he took? Critics make both arguments.
How Mr. Bernanke acts now depends in part on which he sees as the stronger critique. As an academic before joining the Fed, Mr. Bernanke often criticized central bankers for dealing too passively with financial crises and economic malaise. As Fed chief, he has confronted many limitations to the policies he controls."

Since long-term inflation risk is low for younger investors, many longer-dated target-date funds hold significant stock positions and diversify globally, Mr. Charlson said.

Friday, the Fed cut the borrowing rate on its discount window to 5.75% and extended the term from overnight to 30 days, with the option to renew. The central bank left the key federal-funds rate untouched at 5.25%.

WASHINGTON--Federal Reserve officials acknowledged a housing-market bubble more than a year before U.S. house prices peaked, but they showed little inclination to address it, according to transcripts of their 2005 meetings released Friday.
During 2005, the Fed raised interest rates a quarter-percentage point at every meeting, unwinding the ultra-loose policy it pursued earlier in the decade to address deflation worries after the 2001 recession. The economy at the time was growing at a healthy pace with few signs of overheating. But with reports across the U.S. indicating a bubble in the housing market, the Federal Open Market Committee spent time assessing the appreciation in home prices and what, if anything, the Fed could do about it. Fed staff economists had found that housing might be overvalued by as much as 20%, based on the historical relationship between prices and rents.
But Fed officials appeared hamstrung because they believed their most important tool--interest rates--could not address frothy housing markets alone without influencing the broader economy.
""I get very irritated when I see columns suggesting that we are trying to inspire or should be trying to prick a housing bubble,"" said Fed Governor Edward Gramlich, who died in 2007. ""There is no way to do that and still maximize the inflation/unemployment outcome. Monetary policy is broad and has broad effects."""

The minutes of the Sept. 20 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee were released Friday after the customary delay of about six weeks. The committee, which consists of all seven Fed governors and the presidents of five regional Fed banks, met again last week.
In September, the members approvingly noted evidence ""that the expansion of economic activity might be moderating from the vigorous pace experienced earlier in the year."" Some members feared the apparent slowing might prove to be only temporary; others thought the Fed had accomplished the goal it set earlier this year of restraining the economy's growth.
Although they agreed that inflation was more likely to intensify than diminish, the members were divided on how much of a risk inflation presented at the time."

January is traditionally the slowest, the least profitable and thus the least significant month of the year for retailers. Much of their business is generated by clearance sales of Christmas and winter merchandise.
Many store chains said the last-minute rush by Christmas shoppers cleared enough space on their store shelves that they didn't need to resort to as deep price cuts as they had in the past two years.

""We were less promotional than last year,"" he said.
Some retailers and economists had projected a big spending drop for January because of the evaporation of many of last year's spending stimulants: falling oil prices, dropping interest rates and anticipation of new tax laws, which, among other things, ended the deductibility of sales taxes.

Overall U.S. government purchases of goods and services in the Baltimore area declined by 15.6 percent from 1990, their peak year, to 1993, the study found. But such purchases rose by 25.8 percent in the Maryland suburbs of Washington over the same period, according to the study, which did not take inflation into account."

Isn't it a little early to start criticizing a plan that is still being developed?
Though we are encouraged by some recent signs of a rebound, the economy is recovering at half the rate of past recessions. A carefully crafted consumer, investor and business tax package would provide the synergies needed to push the economy into high gear and help ensure durable economic growth. In a recent letter to the president, we suggested cutting consumer taxes, allowing larger depreciation write-offs and reducing the double taxation of dividends.
Our studies show that allowing companies to deduct 50% of corporate dividends would add one-half a percentage point to average GDP growth through 2005. Similarly, our study shows that this change would accelerate productivity growth to 2.4% over the next three years, compared with 2% without this change. A phased reduction of the double tax on corporate dividends would encourage firms to rely more on equity financing, leading to higher investment spending and a larger capital stock.
One of the most effective ways to spur business investment and continued technological advances that promote productivity growth is through an enhanced capital-cost recovery system. Finally, accelerating the tax cuts enacted in June 2001 will help ensure that consumer confidence and spending remain strong. Because many small businesses pay taxes at the individual rate, they also will benefit from accelerated rate cuts.

The deficit in goods and services, seasonally adjusted, was $940 million more than October's revised and record $25.56 billion, the Commerce Department reported. Higher oil prices helped fuel the rise, and economists also blamed some of the import surge on year-2000 stockpiling, in which many U.S. car dealers built up their inventories in the latter part of 1999.
But as the trade imbalance continued to swell, there was a tiny ray of sunshine in the November numbers: U.S. export performance, dismal for much of 1999, was slightly improved, rising $557 million to $82.89 billion on increased demand for telecommunications equipment, semiconductors and other products.
Imports, as usual, outperformed exports, swelling to $109.39 billion from October's $107.90 billion. It was the U.S.'s worst trade performance since the Commerce Department started compiling the monthly numbers in 1992.
While steadily climbing trade deficits are worrisome politically, they leave many economists sanguine.

The report argues that the next U.S. president will be faced not only with the tough assignment of restoring the United Statesâ€™ domestic strength, but with fundamental changes that now bind America's future inextricably ""with the progress of the developing countries.""
It also contends that for the longer run, policymakers in both the rich and poor nations must deal with the potential impact of an impending ""third industrial revolution,"" based on new and complex technologies that will be more difficult for the poorer nations to introduce and manage.

842615344,the-'conundrum'-explained,wsj_399027157,2005-06-21,"In recent months, one overriding debate has raged within the world- wide financial community. How can long-term U.S. interest rates be so low? And how can so many economists have been so wrong on their interest rate forecasts? No less a figure than Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, famously described this question as a ""conundrum"" in congressional testimony earlier this year.
It is stunning for the head of our central bank to describe himself as mystified by the behavior of overall rates. But he has plenty of company. This observer cannot recall a bigger disconnect between conventional wisdom and market reality on such a central issue. Indeed, today, yields on 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities have fallen to the astonishingly low levels of 4.1% and 4.4% respectively. Both are lower than the average annual yield for these securities over the last 25 years. These low rates persist even in the face of powerful factors which, in historical terms, should drive them up, including monetary policy itself, a strong U.S. economic growth outlook and the increasingly large size of our current account deficit. This contradiction is, in essence, the conundrum.
Three alternative schools of thought have emerged to explain it. One is that the bond market has overshot. A second is that the growth outlook is actually weaker than the consensus forecast, and the bond market is discounting such slower growth before it manifests itself. But the right answer involves excess global liquidity which, for the moment, has nowhere else to go but into dollar-denominated fixed- income assets like U.S. Treasury securities.
---
Before we proceed, let's review the conundrum itself in detail. Chairman Greenspan's precise comment referred to the unprecedented behavior of longer-term interest rates in light of recent monetary policy. He noted that the Federal Reserve Board has raised the Federal Funds Rate eight times since June, 2004. Mr. Greenspan emphasized that past increases in the shortest-term rates have always pushed up long- term rates. But not this time."

By a 4-1 vote, the Fed board agreed to cut its discount interest rate by half a percentage point, to 5.5% from 6%. The discount rate -- the rate the Fed charges on loans to financial institutions -- is largely symbolic. But in conjunction with the move, the Fed also quietly lowered its target for the important federal funds interest rate to 5.75% from 6%. Other interest rates are expected to fall in turn.
The Fed's move followed several days of international meetings at which the Bush administration argued vehemently but unsuccessfully for global interest-rate cuts. President Bush was quick to praise the Fed's action, saying it was ""very good news"" and showed ""a very strong leadership role by the Fed.""
The Fed's action comes as the Bush administration has begun considering whether to reappoint Alan Greenspan as Fed chairman when his term expires in August. Some administration officials -- including Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and White House Chief of Staff John Sununu -- have been critical of Mr. Greenspan because of the Fed's reluctance to cut rates. But administration officials said Mr. Bush's praise yesterday is a sign that he is likely to reappoint Mr. Greenspan.
Officials familiar with the Fed's deliberations say the board has been debating the rate-cutting move for several weeks. Mr. Greenspan and Fed Governor David Mullins are said to have become increasingly concerned about signs of continued weakness among manufacturers.

Natural gas is used to generate electricity, heat homes and manufacture a variety of chemicals, plastics and fertilizers that in turn are used to make thousands of other products. Mr. Greenspan, appearing before the House energy and commerce committee, said higher natural-gas prices have knocked ""a couple tenths [of a percentage point] off profit margins"" for U.S. companies, which are a key determinant of business investment, currently the economy's weakest spot. At the same time, the costlier fuel is likely to mean higher bills for consumers, taking spending money out of their pockets.
Mr. Greenspan said there is little prospect for natural-gas prices to fall much in coming months. ""If we stay at these very elevated prices, we are going to see some erosion in a number of macroeconomic variables.""
The Fed is already worried about the sluggish pace of economic growth and the risk that low inflation, excluding energy prices, could turn into deflation. It may trim short-term interest rates later this month as insurance against further weakness and deflation.

Analysts believe some of the decline in manufacturing and construction may have been tied to harsh weather during February. But the numbers also seem to suggest that manufacturers have yet to fully recover from the sluggish growth that occurred in last year's third quarter.
""The decline in manufacturing reflects the overbuilding of inventories in late 1984 and increased import penetration as a result of the rapid escalation of the dollar,"" said Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist of the National Association of Manufacturers.
Companies should be able to work off excess inventories in the next month or two. But the problems that manufacturers face as a result of the strong dollar can be expected to continue throughout the year. A strong dollar increases imports by lowering the prices of foreign products, while making U.S. products more costly for overseas buyers."

The Commerce Department reported that the trade gap ballooned to $16.77 billion from a seasonally adjusted $14.55 billion in July. The August total was the largest since the department began keeping the numbers in the current format in 1992, and a department analyst estimated that it was probably the biggest since December 1985. Exports in August slipped to an adjusted $74.84 billion from $75.10 billion in July; it was the lowest figure since the $73.43 billion in shipments in January 1997.
Meanwhile, a growing number of countries continue to ship goods here to try to sell their way out of recession. Imports in August climbed to an adjusted $91.61 billion from $89.65 billion the previous month. Exports were weak across the board, reflecting the spreading economic crisis. The U.S. deficit with Japan, which is mired in recession, swelled to $5.2 billion in August from $4.54 billion a year earlier. The year-over-year comparisons provide the most accurate measurement, since these figures aren't seasonally adjusted.
The overall trade deficit with Pacific Rim countries, including Japan, surged to $15.69 billion from $11.65 billion a year earlier. The U.S. trade surplus with Brazil narrowed to $363 million from $535 million a year earlier.

The unemployment rate stayed at its 28-year low of 4.3% of the work force in May, suggesting that April's drop was no aberration. The economy added 296,000 jobs in May, the Labor Department said. For the past six months, job gains have averaged 257,000 a month and the labor market has been taut.
Wage gains were also healthy during May. Average hourly earnings for nonsupervisory workers increased four cents to a seasonally adjusted $12.73. Average weekly earnings increased 0.9% to $441.73. Average weekly earnings and average hourly earnings have both risen 4.3% during the past year -- without many signs of inflationary pressures.
The economy, though slowing from the 4.8% gross-domestic-product growth rate posted in the first quarter, still continues to generate jobs. Certainly, the Asian financial crisis has had an effect. The manufacturing sector has slowed its rate of growth in the second quarter, and manufacturing jobs declined 26,000 last month, the third drop in the past four months. Those declines, however, were offset by the brisk-paced service sector, which accounted for all of May's job gains. Business services, retail trade and financial sectors all boosted their payrolls in May.

By John D. McKinnon
WASHINGTON -- Congressional budget analysts gave passing marks to two of the leading plans for restoring Social Security solvency through private accounts, including one proposed by a panel set up by President Bush.
The findings by the Congressional Budget Office showed that the Bush panel's plan would produce sharp reductions in benefits by the middle of the century, and also would create huge costs for the government in the meantime, but would eventually put Social Security back on track toward long-term solvency. The analysis, which was requested by several lawmakers studying Social Security's financial problems, suggests that the Bush plan is so effective in reducing benefit costs that backers could afford to ease up a little.
Democrat John Kerry's camp wasted little time in attacking Mr. Bush over the CBO report, focusing on the big cost to the federal government of setting aside a portion of payroll taxes to set up the private investment accounts. ""The president is about to start touting his proposal for the 'ownership society,' but the CBO analysis shows it's more like a debt society,"" said Kerry economic adviser Jason Furman. ""Its biggest impact is to increase debt by trillions of dollars . . . damaging our long-run budget outlook."""

A lower dollar tends to help capital-goods makers like Milacron compete in world markets -- and it also generates business from certain U.S. manufacturers who themselves fare better in world competition. ""(The dollar's drop) may kill the stock market and cause all other kinds of havoc, but it will put us in a better competitive position in world markets,"" Mr. Meyer says optimistically.
The trick at Cincinnati Milacron will be to transfer its present know-how in metal-parts manufacturing and factory automation into related businesses with world-wide growth. For Mr. Meyer, former executive vice president and chief financial officer, the assignment is to do it profitably.
""Putting a finance man in as president is a clear signal that the company will emphasize profitability,"" says Eli S. Lustgarten, machinery analyst with PaineWebber Inc. ""The board wanted somebody less emotionally tied to operations to take a hard look at what costs can be eliminated.""
Mr. Meyer, an Indiana native who has worked for Milacron since 1969, says he has already begun a cost-cutting scrutiny. ""The whole cost structure is under review right now,"" he says.

Traders interpreted Mr. Volcker's remarks as an indication that the Fed won't tighten its credit policy. Some analysts say the Fed may even loosen its credit grip and push down interest rates in an effort to stimulate the economy.
Prices of some actively traded U.S. Treasury bonds surged more than a point, or more than $10 for each $1,000 face amount of securities. Most short-term interest rates fell.
The rally erased the sharp declines in bond prices registered Monday when the markets were jolted by the collapse of a small securities firm. The company, Bevill, Bresler & Schulman Asset Management Corp. in Livingston, N.J., was placed under bankruptcy-law protection. That aroused worry among some dealers that foreign investors, concerned about the U.S. financial system, might shy away from purchasing additional U.S. securities.
Mr. Volcker, speaking at a conference sponsored by the Export-Import Bank of the U.S., said he was concerned about ""imbalances"" in the U.S. economy. He pointed to the lackluster performance of several sectors, notably mining, manufacturing and agriculture."

Freddie Mac said Thursday in its weekly nationwide survey that rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 5.98 percent this week, down from 6 percent last week. The rate was the lowest since late April, when 30-year rates averaged 5.94 percent.
Since peaking at a high for this year of 6.34 percent in mid- May, 30-year mortgage rates have been headed lower, reflecting in part a slowdown in economic activity in June.
The economy hit what Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Tuesday termed a ""soft patch"" in June. Greenspan, however, in delivering the Fed's mid-year economic forecast to Congress, sought to allay fears that the slowdown could threaten the sustainability of the recovery. He predicted that growth would soon rebound even as the Fed proceeds with what Greenspan indicated should be a gradual pace of rate increases.
Frank Nothaft, chief economist at Freddie Mac, said that the Fed's outlook for the second half of this year was ""more upbeat than expected,"" and he said this stronger growth will translate into further increases in mortgage rates and other interest rates set by financial markets along with the rise in short-term rates controlled by the Fed. ""However, the rise in mortgage rates will be measured, not extreme, and that will help keep the housing industry stable and affordable in the coming months,"" he said."

""Job growth was solid, but wage pressures were completely absent in October,"" said Bill Cheney, chief economist at John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. ""The inflation threat has receded yet again.""
The new numbers, combined with some signs the economy may be slowing, will bolster those inside the Federal Reserve arguing against an interest-rate increase when policy makers meet Nov. 16.
The anemic growth in wages, in particular, gives Fed officials more breathing room to see whether the economy is slowing on its own, or whether growth can continue at the current pace without sparking inflation.

The start of 1988 is no exception. Indeed, the degree of interest seems exceptional even for a new year. This reflects concern that last fall's stock-market crash may have signaled an approaching recession, as well as uneasiness over the extraordinary longevity of the expansion, which reached the five-year mark in November.
Happily, most forecasters reckon that the economy will keep expanding as 1988 unfolds. But this consensus deserves close scrutiny. It expects only a sluggish advance, with overall business activity rising about 2%. Such a pace would provide a perilously slim cushion in the event of unpleasant surprises. And important considerations point to just such a possibility.
Primary among these considerations is the cautionary message provided by last October's market crash.
This century has witnessed only eight earlier declines in the Dow Jones Industrial Average that approximately matched or exceeded the 1987 slide -- from August 25 to October 19, a wrenching 36.1% drop. In seven of the eight previous declines, as recently noted on this page, the economy also slumped, sometimes starting down at roughly the same time as the market and sometimes more than a year later. The sole exception was in World War II when, with the all-out military buildup, the economy kept rising even though share prices fell more than 40%.
In predicting more recession-free growth as 1988 goes along, most forecasters apparently believe that the recent 36.1% market slide will prove another exception to the century-long record. Perhaps this will be the case, but experience suggests otherwise."

While some investors tremble at the prospect of inflation, grocers like Kroger wouldn't mind a little more of it.
The biggest U.S. grocery-store chain is due on Tuesday morning to report earnings for its fiscal third quarter, which ended in November. Analysts, on average, estimate it earned 37 cents a share in the quarter, down slightly from 39 cents a year ago.
So far, recession-generated price competition is hurting most traditional grocery-store chains, as shellshocked consumers have fled to cheaper, big-box competitors such as Wal-Mart Stores and Costco Wholesale. On Wal-Mart's earnings call last month, Chief Executive Mike Duke said Wal-Mart plans to ""widen the gap with our competitors on price leadership.""

Airlines already slashed their available seat miles by about 7% in the first quarter compared with the same period in 2008. Traffic has fallen further, though, declining at least 10% in March compared with a year earlier. Revenue is being dragged down even more by fare sales and a plunge in pricier cross-border and premium-class bookings.
Most U.S. airlines are expected to unveil big first-quarter losses, including AMR Corp.'s American Airlines, the first major carrier to report, on Wednesday. Some low-cost carriers, including Southwest Airlines Co., which reports on Thursday, could post small quarterly profits.

""In the last several months I've stared at our unemployment forecast and come to the conclusion that it's just not coming down nearly as quickly as it should,"" Mr. Evans said Monday in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. ""This is a far grimmer forecast than we ought to have,"" he added. As result, he said, he favors ""much more [monetary] accommodation than we've put in place.""
The comments are significant because Mr. Evans tends to reflect the broad center of gravity at the central bank. His prescription for aggressive action, though not uniformly held by his colleagues, suggests a shift in the mood at the Fed.
On the heels of remarks by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and New York Federal Reserve Bank President William Dudley, it is likely to reinforce a growing conviction among investors that the Fed will restart a bond-buying program when it meets Nov. 2 and 3.

Wal-Mart Stores lowered its fiscal-year earnings forecast today, even as the world's biggest retailer reported that its second-quarter net income rose 49% to $3.11 billion, or 76 cents a share. The positive quarterly comparison was largely due to a charge in the year- earlier period, and CEO Lee Scott didn't try to hide his disappointment in his company's latest results. ""Our underlying operating performance this quarter is not what we expect of ourselves, and not what our shareholders expect of us,"" he said in a statement. The retail giant said sluggishness in the overall economy contributed to its weaker outlook, but some of the problems are of Wal-Mart's making. Price cuts that opened the key back-to-school season lowered gross margin at U.S. stores by half a percentage point, yet piles of spring apparel remain unsold. Still, executives noted that inventory grew at a slower rate than sales during the second quarter, reversing an issue that plagued the retailer during its first quarter. Meanwhile, the cooling housing market continued to hamper Home Depot's quarterly earnings. The home-improvement retailer saw its net income drop 15% to $1.59 billion, although these results came in ahead of Wall Street expectations. The company also hinted at the possibility that the proposed sale of its supply business might not go through under current terms. Shares of Wal-Mart fell 5.1%, while Home Depot slid 4.9%.
In his conference call, Wal-Mart's Mr. Scott emphasized the financial difficulties crimping the retailer's core demographic of modest-income shoppers. ""It is no secret that many customers are running out of money towards the end of the month,"" he said. ""The paycheck cycle is, in fact, more pronounced now than it ever has been."" Evidence of consumer unease could be seen in the 14% quarterly sales gain Wal-Mart supercenters notched for groceries, whose rock- bottom prices draw budget-stressed consumers. Pharmacy and electronic sales also improved during the quarter. But home-related items and clothing, with their wider profit margins, remained a downer for the retailer. Analysts saw evidence that Wal-Mart executives are taking steps to fix those factors in the company's control, but many remain cool on the retailer's near-term prospects. A.G. Edwards analysts called it an ""ebb tide in low-end consumer spending."" Goldman Sachs faulted ""the tougher macro environment"" for making the company's turnaround ""even tougher to enact,"" and warned of retail-sector fallout from any further price cuts: Wal-Mart's ""efforts to clear inventory could pressure other discounters this holiday season."" And HSBC's note, echoing Mr. Scott, affirmed that the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle means that, for consumers, ""inflation takes a bite out of real spending growth.""
In that regard, there was a glimmer of good news in economic data released Tuesday. Despite another jump in energy prices, July data on U.S. wholesale prices were unlikely to stir inflation concerns. The producer price index for finished goods rose 0.6%, but the core number that excludes more volatile food and energy prices was up just 0.1% -- slightly below Wall Street expectations. Even more unexpected was Tuesday's trade data: the U.S. deficit narrowed in June due to surprising strength in exports. Growth in U.S. demand for imported goods also slowed slightly, knocking the trade gap down 1.7% to $58.14 billion. The trade deficit from May was also revised downward to $59.16 billion. Strength in the global economy at large, combined with continued weakness in the dollar, helped enhance demand for U.S. exports. Bear Stearns analysts wrote that the trade numbers will likely lead the Commerce Department to revise second-quarter economic growth around 4.3% from an originally reported 3.4%.

A rise in the price of gold is the best signal that we have to indicate that there is diminished confidence about the future purchasing-power reliability of money. The price of gold rises when the most savvy and suspicious investors believe the Fed has become a less reliable guardian of the value of our money. Or they may believe that in our democracy the president or Congress may pressure the Fed to lower interest rates. These suspicious investors would move out of dollars and into gold if they thought that the government was leaning on the Fed to lessen its commitment to price stability.
Last week's interest rate cut raises questions about whether it might have been a politically motivated deal. It was unusual that the discount rate was cut by only one-quarter of 1% -- you have to go back to 1978 to see such a small change in the discount rate -- and yet six Fed banks (including all five of the banks whose presidents have an Federal Open Market Committee vote) requested the move. Based on minutes from the Dec. 19 FOMC meeting, there were some members who would have preferred to leave rates unchanged and were unsure, after the rate cut at that meeting, what the direction of the next rate move would be. Where were their voices at the January meeting? Remember, the term of Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan runs out March 2, only eight months before the presidential election.
On Jan. 31, the Fed ignored the warning signal from the 8% rise in the price of gold above the 1995 average. The Fed effectively said that even though there is some move out of dollars into gold, it will declare inflation to be satisfactory and give another small shove toward growth. Since the discount rate announcement, the price of gold has risen $11, to $415 an ounce; 30-year bonds have fallen two points in price, taking the yield up to 6.17% despite economic data that ought to have been favorable for bonds; and the dollar has fallen two yen, to 105 yen. Why was the immediate response to this monetary policy change so adverse?
1. The rise in the price of gold was ignored by the Fed. Standing pat or doing nothing could have achieved a great deal. The Fed could have demonstrated its concern by leaving the funds rate unchanged at 5.5%. If the Fed had not ignored the signal, the suspicions that led to a preference for gold probably would have abated."

For retailers, it's beginning to look a lot like a sluggish Christmas, the Fed concluded in a summary of reports collected by the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks in September and October. Sales of fall and back-to-school goods were almost uniformly ""disappointing or below expectations,"" the Fed said.
Manufacturing picked up in some districts, however. The Philadelphia Fed, for example, found strong demand for electrical machinery, metals and glass products. ""It's not a boom, mind you,"" a steel production representative cautioned the Chicago Fed. Indeed, purchase orders mostly softened in the Dallas and Cleveland districts.
In keeping with what analysts call a slow but steadily growing economy, construction improved slightly, and there was a ""firming"" in commercial and industrial leasing activity. Also, inflation remains under control. Wage gains were moderate, despite mostly tight labor markets, and reports of rapidly rising materials costs fell off substantially, the report said.
But the reluctance of consumers to spend is keeping the slow-rolling economy from shedding its training wheels.

It's true that industrial production has grown twice as fast as the economy as a whole in this recovery, and manufacturers are adding jobs again. But economists see those gains as too small relative to what was lost in previous years to suggest a full-blown revival. Factories fell so hard, the logic goes, some gains are a given.
""There's simply no statistical evidence of a broader renaissance at this point,"" says Daniel Meckstroth, chief economist with the Manufacturers Alliance for Productivity and Innovation, an Arlington, Va., group that represents mostly large U.S. producers.
Mr. Meckstroth says measures that look deeper inside the sector continue to flash warning signs. Take factory closings. For the past 13 years, the rate factories have been closing has been declining. That's good. The trouble is the rate of openings has been falling even faster. Simply put, America's factories are dying faster than they're being born.
To be sure, many U.S. manufacturers are doing better than they have in some time. That's visible in hiring. Manufacturers have added more than 500,000 jobs since early 2010, and Monday's report from the Institute for Supply Management is expected to show manufacturers continued expanding in March.

A more useful place to look for guidance on regulation of the financial system is Daniel Tarullo, a Federal Reserve Board governor and its point man for banking reform. Mr. Tarullo gave a speech in Chicago on May 8 that was as unsettling as it was, by the Fed's inscrutable standards, unguarded.
Addressing the Chicago Fed Bank Structure Conference, Mr. Tarullo proposed that the central bank must ""broaden the perimeter of prudential regulation, both to certain nonbank financial institutions and to certain activities by all financial actors."" This expansion of regulatory authority would take the Fed far beyond the current power it exercises thanks to the Dodd-Frank law passed in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crises. The casualties of such an expansion could include small- and medium-size banks.
Under Dodd-Frank, ultimate financial regulatory power resides with the Financial Stability Oversight Council, or FSOC, a council of 10 regulators chaired by the Treasury and which includes the Fed chairman. The FSOC can designate asset managers, mutual funds, hedge funds, or even broker-dealers as systemically important financial institutions, or SIFIs, a classification that puts an institution under the Fed's regulatory authority. The council has already designated the large insurers AIG and Prudential as SIFIs, and it has many more nonbank financial companies in its sights.
The council's moves are part of a larger blueprint that Mr. Tarullo has now laid out. In the Chicago speech, he proposed ditching complex Basel III capital and liquidity regulations and reducing regulations on small banks. The new system he outlined would use simpler, Basel I capital charges for small banks, on grounds that the failure of these banks would pose no threat to financial stability. Larger regional banks would require slightly elevated regulatory standards, but nothing too complex.
Once a bank joins a ""club"" of the 80 largest institutions, however, the Federal Reserve should be its regulator, Mr. Tarullo said, and regulation should focus on annual stress tests. The very largest institutions, U.S. global banks and nonbank SIFIs, would receive the most intrusive Fed oversight and be required to satisfy the full range of new international macroprudential rules."

In the lead-up to his appearance, there had been growing speculation that the Fed chairman might signal the central bank's willingness to cease paying interest on the reserves it holds on banks' behalf, a move that would be an incentive for banks to lend that money to customers.

The ratio of retail inventories to sales ""has rocketed in the last few months"" to a 20-year high, says Norman Robertson, chief economist of Mellon Bank, Pittsburgh. Commerce Department figures show business inventories grew at a $58.3 billion annual rate in the fourth quarter. That could reflect retailer stockpiling of imported goods or the increased difficulty of selling imports at higher prices. But many economists fear that the buildup comes from slowing consumer spending and that recession and layoffs will follow.

But some Wall Street executives say they have seen some signs of a pickup in the past few weeks, since the passage of the attacks' first anniversary.
The impact of events in the third quarter was even more severe on disclosed underwriting fees, a more-telling barometer for Wall Street. Fees fell 21% to $2.31 billion amid a falloff in more-lucrative stock deals, such as initial public offerings.

842614834,reigning-wisdom's-shaky-economic-ground,wsj_397948680,1984-03-14,"Many economists and economic scribes have arrived at a particular gloomy paradigm to describe the current U.S. economy. This consensus is surprising because the paradigm itself is seriously flawed.
The paradigm consists of four propositions: First, government deficits are responsible for high interest rates; second, high interest rates are responsible for the ""overvalued"" dollar; third, the overvalued dollar is responsible for the huge increase in the U.S. trade deficit; and, finally, the trade deficit is just plain bad.
The validity of the propositions is limited and decreases rapidly as one moves down the list.
Consider the first proposition. As Treasury Secretary Donald Regan keeps reminding us, empirical analysis shows no statistically significant historical relationship between budget deficits and interest rates. Over the past three years, while the deficit has more than tripled, the prime rate -- the base interest rate that commercial banks charge on loans to their biggest borrowers with the best credit ratings -- has fallen to 11% from 18.9%. Adjusting interest rates for inflation to approximate the ""real"" rate of interest doesn't change the picture very much: During the same period the real rate fell to 7% from 10%, notwithstanding the tripled deficit.
Nevertheless, there is common-sense validity to the notion that larger government borrowing will, other things being equal, exert upward pressure on rates. (However, one point that's usually neglected by those who advance this argument is that efforts to reduce the deficit by increasing taxes may also exert upward pressure on interest rates because increased taxes will result in decreased private savings, rather than simply in reduced private spending.)"

But they face many unresolved questions about whether to make such a move, and if so when, and several events in the coming days could shed light on their thinking.
Fed Vice Chairwoman Janet Yellen testifies before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday in a hearing on her nomination to lead the Fed when Chairman Ben Bernanke's term ends in January. Mr. Bernanke speaks at the National Economic Club next Tuesday. And the Fed on Wednesday releases minutes of its October meeting, at which the idea likely was discussed.
The Fed's vow to keep interest rates low for a long time is one of its key tools to rev up the economy, given that it has cut short-term rates nearly to zero. The commitment is one of two pillars of the Fed's easy-money policy, the other one being an $85 billion monthly bond-buying program. Officials might start scaling back the bond-buying program in the coming months, possibly as early as December, but want to reassure the public and investors they won't raise interest rates for a long time after they end the program.
The Fed has said for months it won't raise short-term interest rates from near zero until the unemployment rate, which was 7.3% in October, falls below 6.5%, as long as inflation doesn't move above 2.5%. Fed officials believe the promise, known as ""forward guidance,"" helps hold down long-term borrowing rates, which in turn encourages borrowing, investment and spending."

An urgency to rein in budget deficits seems to be gaining some traction among American lawmakers. If so, it is none too soon. Perceptions of a large U.S. borrowing capacity are misleading.
Despite the surge in federal debt to the public during the past 18 months--to $8.6 trillion from $5.5 trillion--inflation and long-term interest rates, the typical symptoms of fiscal excess, have remained remarkably subdued. This is regrettable, because it is fostering a sense of complacency that can have dire consequences.
The roots of the apparent debt market calm are clear enough. The financial crisis, triggered by the unexpected default of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, created a collapse in global demand that engendered a high degree of deflationary slack in our economy. The very large contraction of private financing demand freed private saving to finance the explosion of federal debt. Although our financial institutions have recovered perceptibly and returned to a degree of solvency, banks, pending a significant increase in capital, remain reluctant to lend.
Beneath the calm, there are market signals that do not bode well for the future. For generations there had been a large buffer between the borrowing capacity of the U.S. government and the level of its debt to the public. But in the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers collapse, that gap began to narrow rapidly. Federal debt to the public rose to 59% of GDP by mid-June 2010 from 38% in September 2008. How much borrowing leeway at current interest rates remains for U.S. Treasury financing is highly uncertain."

The Economic Report of the President, released yesterday, said the growth in U.S. productivity, which is a measure of the output per hour worked, has averaged about 2% a year since 1991 -- more than twice the 1978-87 average. Some of that may reflect a rebound from the recession; but even if measured from 1987, productivity has grown 1.2%, up from 0.9% in the 10 previous years.
""There may have, indeed, been a structural change"" in productivity growth, said Laura Tyson, chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers. Such an increase could have positive implications for Americans' standards of living, which are ultimately determined by the productivity of American workers.
But the president's economic report also points out that it may be too soon to jump to conclusions about productivity growth. For one thing, the statistics can be misleading. If the trends are computed for different periods -- 1978-86 and 1986-94 -- productivity growth averages only 1.1% in the latest period, up from 1% in the earlier period, not much of a difference. Also, recently released Labor Department data on hours worked suggest that productivity could be revised downward by one-tenth of a percentage point in 1993 and 1994.
""While the evidence of a slight improvement in the productivity growth trend is encouraging, it is not yet decisive,"" the report said, adding that two more years of data may present a clearer picture."

Well, let's see. We can think of several serious people who said we could heal the economy in four years. There's Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, Christina Romer, Jared Bernstein, Mark Zandi, and, most importantly, President Obama himself.
Mr. Obama told Americans in 2009 that if he did not turn around the economy in three years his Presidency would be ""a one-term proposition."" Joe Biden said three years ago that the $830 billion economic stimulus was working beyond his ""wildest dreams"" and he famously promised several months after the Obama stimulus was enacted that Americans would enjoy a ""summer of recovery.""

Arthur Okun, the Presidentâ€™s chief economic adviser, contrived a fitting analogy the other day when he compared the U.S. economy with a fat lady munching candy.
""Nobody can promise her a lovely figure overnight if she stops nibbling. Nobody can legitimately warn her that one more piece would do incalulable damage. And foregoing the candy means sacrificing a lot of fun in the short run. But the more she overindulges, the more serious the risks become. The time to stop our economic overindulgence is now.â€ù
In its competition with other industrial countries, the United States is fast becoming the â€œfat lady"" of international trade. The rate of growth of The Nationâ€™s imports is closely related to the growth of Gross National Product. When GNP grows at high rates, imports rise even more rapidly. In years when the economy has expanded by 8 per cent or moreâ€”as it is likely to do this yearâ€”imports have increased by more than 15 per cent.
First-quarter trade figures, compiled by the Census Bureau, confirm that a big upsurge in imports is under way. Imports in the Janu-ary-March period (seasonally adjusted) rose 10 per cent over the fourth quarter and topped the year earlier period by 17 per cent. With the economy expanding rapidly and with consumer spending climbing steeply, imports will continue to increase.

The dispute over amnesty marks the first real rift in the multi-party and multiracial government that came to power under President Nelson Mandela following South Africa's historic democratic election last April. It was not seen as a coalition-breaker, however, and de Klerk stopped short of threatening to quit the government.
Rumors that de Klerk might pull his former ruling National Party out of the cabinet - where it holds a deputy presidency and six of 27 ministries - raced through political and business circles today, setting off a minor tremor on the stock market. But in a speech tonight to a National Party congress, de Klerk said that while he had considered resigning in the face of a dressing down in Wednesday's cabinet meeting by Mandela, he concluded that South Africa's fragile transition to democracy demands that all major parties work together.
De Klerk, who was president when Mandela was elected, said he and his party will oppose a cabinet decision that invalidated the controversial amnesty, which was granted under the de Klerk government just before last April's election. He also issued a veiled demand for an apology from Mandela, insisting that the leadership of Mandela's African National Congress ""take appropriate steps, without delay, to remedy the unfair, unjustified and unacceptable attack on our integrity and good faith.""
De Klerk and Mandela are expected to meet Friday to try to patch up what has become a badly damaged relationship."

Housing starts rose 2.4% in July to an annual rate of 1,489,000 units, the Commerce Department said. Starts of single-family units fell slightly, while starts of multifamily units rose for the first time in three months. The department also revised its June report to show an overall increase of 4.4%. The rise previously was reported at 5.1%.
""That's likely to be the highest increase for the rest of the year as higher interest rates are going to have a much more serious impact on the industry,"" said Bob Sheehan, economist at the National Apartment Association.
Single-family units starts in July decreased by 0.8% to an annual rate of 1,089,000 units. In June, this sector saw an increase of 8.5%. In May, the rate declined 8.1%. Single-family construction starts in July were 5.4% below the July 1987 pace.

Prices of some Treasury bonds surged more than a point, or more than $10 for each $1,000 face amount. Most short-term interest rates declined. Traders were ""almost euphoric"" as rumors of an impending oil-price reduction swirled through the credit markets, said Donald E. Maude, chief economist at Refco Partners.
Another cut in oil prices would give the Federal Reserve System additional latitude to ease credit conditions, paving the way for further declines in U.S. interest rates, according to many investment managers. They say an oil-price cut would enhance the prospects for continued low inflation.
After surveying oil-company executives, Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, an industry newsletter, concluded that oil prices ""will remain weak or continue to slide"" unless the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries takes ""strong corrective action."" A majority of executives surveyed said they expect a ""virtually uninterrupted period of depressed demand"" for oil over the next 18 months or more.
Even without a reduction in oil prices, many analysts expect lower interest rates. They say that the economy is picking up only moderately from its sluggish first-quarter performance and that the Fed will ease its credit policy further in an effort to stimulate business activity."

Indeed, the report seems unlikely to spark much panic in one place it matters most, the Federal Reserve, which is charged with keeping inflation in check. In comments over the past few weeks, top officials have been more likely to marvel about the tameness of prices than to express concern about nascent inflation.
""The sticker shock . . . exaggerates the inflation numbers,"" economists at Warburg Dillon Reed LLC wrote Friday in a report to clients, adding that the price rises ""do not represent a significant change in the underlying trend of inflation."" The Fed, too, ""will be able to look past these developments,"" the Warburg analysts concluded. While the odds of a central-bank interest-rate increase next month may be rising, they said, ""they are not yet above 50% in our opinion.""
The numbers in the Labor Department's producer-price report for September were, indeed, stunning. The index for finished goods soared by 1.1%, seasonally adjusted, the biggest monthly increase in nine years. That followed a large 0.5% jump in August, an especially terrible back-to-back performance for a price gauge that has been flat or negative for much of the past two years. Even stripping out the volatile food and energy sectors, the so-called core index jumped by a hefty 0.8%.
The stock-market reaction was equally dramatic. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 266.90, or 2.6%, to 10019.71, and briefly dipped below 10000 for the first time since April.

Forecasters in the administration, at the Fed and throughout the private economy have been expecting that the nationâ€™s output of goods and services would be increasing by now at an annual rate of 4 percent, at least.

From Japan, the U.S. wants stepped-up government spending to stimulate its economy.
