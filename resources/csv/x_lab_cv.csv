842617107,"bentsen-won't-rule-out-delay-in-tax-increase-----postponing-levy-on-income-may-not-be-necessary,-treasury-secretary-says",wsj_398307943,1993-02-22,"WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said the Clinton administration is willing to consider delaying its proposed increases in personal income taxes to shield the economy from harm this year, but said he doubts that will be necessary.
President Clinton's economic plan calls for making the increases in income-tax rates for upper-income Americans retroactive to Jan. 1, 1993. Mr. Bentsen indicated some congressional Democrats fear such a move could interfere with Mr. Clinton's goal of creating 500,000 jobs this year.
Mr. Bentsen said the discussions with lawmakers, however, don't anticipate any delay in the increase in the corporate income tax, which would also be retroactive to Jan. 1. Jobs Are Paramount ""What we want to be sure of is that we achieve the 500,000 jobs,"" Mr. Bentsen said in an interview yesterday. Although expressing a willingness to consider the congressional concerns, Mr. Bentsen said he believes the recent decline in long-term interest rates would more than compensate for any slowing of the economy that might be caused by the higher tax rates.
Lower interest rates encourage businesses and consumers to borrow and spend, and Mr. Bentsen said the decline in interest rates in response to the Clinton plan has been ""more than I anticipated."" On Friday, the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond dropped to 7%, its lowest mark since the government began issuing the bonds regularly in 1977.
Delaying the effective dates of the new 36% and 39.6% marginal income tax rates for a year would reduce by about $10 billion the revenue Mr. Clinton's plan would produce. But Mr. Bentsen said the administration would move up the effective dates of other tax increases to compensate so that it could still reach its 1997 deficit-reduction goal. The new energy tax, for instance, could be phased in more rapidly; currently, it is to be phased in over three years beginning July 1, 1994."
842617324,u.s.-news:-consumer-caution-dents-retailers'-holiday-hopes,wsj_1612181945,2014-10-16,"A downturn in consumer spending threw a new domestic worry into mounting global turmoil, threatening to again undercut hopes for a breakout performance in the U.S. economy.
Retail sales fell 0.3% in September, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. The broad-based decline came alongside weakening consumer confidence and minimal wage growth that has weighed on the recovery in recent years.
While spending at retailers is up 4.3% from a year earlier, double the pace of inflation, the September stumble continues a choppy pattern that shows many Americans are cautious heading into the holiday shopping season.
""We're still trudging along, but not at the accelerating pace that we'd like to see,"" said Moody's Analytics economist Scott Hoyt. The data don't change expectations for modest U.S. growth in gross domestic product, ""but it's a cautionary note.""
September's reading also could be reversed or revised next month. A slowdown from strong summer auto sales, falling gasoline prices and the timing of Apple Inc.'s iPhone 6 release all played a role in the latest data. Earlier concerns of a consumer slowdown in July were eased when sales for that month were revised up to a respectable 0.3% gain from an initial flat reading."
842615686,crisis-on-wall-street:-hartford-allays-concerns-and-stock-doubles,wsj_399119572,2008-12-06,"Life-insurance stocks climbed sharply, when Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. became the second big insurer this past week to allay investors' concerns that it might have to raise additional capital.
The company, whose shares doubled to $14.59 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, said it had ample resources to maintain its financial-strength ratings even if the stock market worsens.
Shares of life insurers have been widely sold off in recent months because of concerns about steep investment-portfolio losses and charges against earnings tied to their businesses of selling variable annuities with guaranteed minimum returns. Investors have worried that insurers will be hard-pressed to come up with additional capital they may need to show regulators they can deliver on promises to consumers.
""The Hartford is well capitalized with ample liquidity,"" Chief Executive Ramani Ayer told investors in a presentation Friday.
Lizabeth Zlatkus, Hartford's chief financial officer, said that the falling stock market could trigger a big charge on the company's variable-annuity business but that the company has access to sufficient capital to retain its ratings under various bearish scenarios. Those include a drop in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to 700. The index finished Friday at 876.07. (At Dec. 31, 2007, it stood at 1468.)"

It was the most active year, in terms of volume, for the computer-aided trading activity that critics blame for causing artificially sharp moves in the market. But because overall volume also soared on the exchange, the percentage figure of 11.3% wasn't a record; indeed, it represented a decline from last year's 11.6%. (The record was 11.9% in 1993.)
The Big Board has released program-trading data since mid-1988, in response to an outcry over the multistock trading activity and its role in the 1987 stock-market crash. Program trading is defined as the buying or selling of a group of at least 15 different stocks valued at a total of $1 million or more.
The five most active program-trading firms in 1995 through the end of September, the latest numbers available, were Morgan Stanley Group Inc.; First Options; the U.S. unit of Japan's Nomura Securities; CS First Boston, a unit of CS Holding; and Salomon Inc.'s Salomon Brothers unit.
The best-known form of program trading is index arbitrage, in which traders buy and sell baskets of stocks with offsetting trades of futures and options. In 1995, such trading accounted for 30.3% of overall program trading, down from nearly 39% in 1994."

Declining consumer sentiment and business concerns over policy uncertainty weigh on the minds of all of us. We must fix our economy's growth and jobs machine.
We can do this. The U.S. economy has the talent, ideas, energy and capital for the robust economic growth that has characterized much of America's experience in our lifetimes. Our standard of living and the nation's standing as a world power depend on restoring that growth.
But to do so we must have vastly different policies aimed at stopping runaway federal spending and debt, reforming our tax code and entitlement programs, and scaling back costly regulations. Those policies cannot be found in the president's proposals. They are, however, the core of Gov. Mitt Romney's plan for economic recovery and renewal.
In response to the recession, the Obama administration chose to emphasize costly, short-term fixes--ineffective stimulus programs, myriad housing programs that went nowhere, and a rush to invest in ""green"" companies.
As a consequence, uncertainty over policy--particularly over tax and regulatory policy--slowed the recovery and limited job creation. One recent study by Scott Baker and Nicholas Bloom of Stanford University and Steven Davis of the University of Chicago found that this uncertainty reduced GDP by 1.4% in 2011 alone, and that returning to pre-crisis levels of uncertainty would add about 2.3 million jobs in just 18 months."

At least that's the conviction of market watchers, who note with glee how the invention of individual retirement accounts and 401(k) accounts have transformed the markets in the past two decades. Last year, almost $20 billion a month in new money flowed into the stock market from mutual funds.
But some experts caution that such a huge shift could further pump up stock prices that some already consider inflated, while possibly hurting the bond market.
Clinton is proposing diverting 62 percent of an anticipated $4 trillion federal budget surplus over the next 15 years to Social Security, then investing less than one-quarter of that amount in the equity markets instead of Treasury securities, in which the fund now invests.
Clinton also wants to take another 11 percent of the budget surplus to establish ""universal savings accounts,"" which would be similar to the 401(k) accounts that many employers offer. Together, the two proposals could add as much as $6.5 billion or so a month to the market."

Meanwhile, the dollar forged ahead to a 16-month high against the German mark, continuing the remarkable rally that began Thursday. Bond prices sank as traders anticipated big debt sales by Uncle Sam. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond dropped nearly five-eighths of a point, or about $6.25 of each $1,000 face amount.
Analysts said the growing realization among investors that the Federal Reserve isn't likely to push short-term interest rates lower soon is behind the big moves in both stocks and the dollar. Without Fed action, many investors doubt a U.S. economic rebound will start soon or be very robust.
At the same time, the Fed's reluctance to lower short-term rates while interest rates abroad are falling makes the returns available in the U.S. more attractive to foreign investors, thus contributing to the strength of the U.S. currency."

Market pundits spend a lot of time worrying about what will happen to the U.S. economy if consumer spending suddenly slows. Maybe it's time to worry about what will happen if it doesn't.
Economic growth has been sluggish for much of the past year, thanks largely to the housing downturn. Consumers have kept on spending, and they have helped to keep the economy on an even keel. Economic output grew at an annual rate of just 0.6% in the first quarter. Had it not been for a 4.4% rate of increase in consumer outlays, the economy likely would have contracted."

The National Association of Realtors said yesterday that the February increase put sales of existing, single-family homes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.13 million units.
The February bounce, which essentially erased a 7.3 percent plunge in January, was attributed to falling home prices and lower mortgage rates luring buyers back into the market following the end of the Persian Gulf War.
""After months of sputtering, it looks as though many markets across the nation have passed their low point and are regaining strength. People are ready to buy,"" said Harley Rouda, NAR president.

Analysts said the report provided further confirmation that growth has slowed recently from the very rapid pace of the first half of this year, which many economists and policymakers regarded as unsustainable. However, the details showed little sign of excessive weakness that would point to a serious slump.
While employers added 94,000 workers to their payrolls, the total number of hours worked last month fell 0.2 percent as firms cut back slightly on the length of the average workweek. The reduction was sharpest in the manufacturing sector, where payrolls were virtually unchanged but hours worked dropped by 0.7 percent.
""It looks pretty favorable to me,"" said economist James Glassman of Chase Securities in New York. ""You have more confirmation of the slowing in growth, but not so much that unemployment is rising sharply. If you could freeze everything where it is now, it would be just about perfect.
""Growth has slowed to a sustainable rate, workers' pay is going up and inflation fears are waning,"" Glassman said. ""Everybody has gotten gloomy about the outlook because of companies warning about profits and the stock market is down. In financial markets, there is stress and worry about credit problems. But to me this is all part of the process of cooling off from a superheated growth rate."""

The slight firming, which occurred before the end of the month, was to take place unless economic and financial-market conditions ""were to differ markedly"" from expectations, according to minutes of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. The move was the third tightening by the central bank this year.
Moreover, the committee members leaned toward a further firming. The panel decided that before its next meeting, ""some added reserve restraint would be acceptable, or some slight lessening of reserve pressure might be acceptable, depending on ongoing economic and financial developments."" Since the meeting, the Fed has indicated it has made no significant changes in policy, but it has appeared to be willing to err slightly on the side of a tighter policy.
The minutes were released after the customary delay of six to eight weeks. The committee held another meeting last week. Minutes of that meeting won't be released until next month.
The panel's May move toward tighter credit reflected a perceived need ""to counter the risks of rising inflationary pressures in the economy,"" the minutes said, and a view that a failure to act would mean more stringent steps would be needed later. The members said the economy remained strong, with unemployment relatively low and factories using a rising percentage of available capacity."

One benefit in Mr. Bush's proposal would boost the child tax credit to $1,000 from the current $600. The jump is expensive -- nearly $90 billion through 2013, official estimates show. By limiting the increase to one year, as some Senate tax writers are now considering, the price tag would shrivel to about $15 billion.
Another provision Republicans may target would triple the expensing limit for small businesses. The annual cap today is $25,000; under Mr. Bush's proposal, it would immediately rise to $75,000, carrying an estimated cost of about $29 billion over the next 10 years. Republicans are eyeing cheaper options, such as only doubling the cap and letting it to expire after a few years.
The changes are necessary if the Senate is to stay within its budget limit of a $350 billion, 10-year tax-cut package. If tax writers can find ways to offset extra costs, the final figure could grow to $400 billion.
Despite the $350 billion lid -- set by Republican moderates who worry about the ballooning federal deficit -- Mr. Bush wants Congress to approve the dividend-tax repeal that is the centerpiece of his economic-growth plan. That package, unveiled in January, has a 10-year price tag of $725 billion, more than half for dividend-tax relief."

Money funds are likely to regain appeal once interest rates rise again. Historically, when rates start moving upward, money-fund yields quickly follow, unlike those of bank savings accounts, which can lag.
But for now, persistently low rates--coupled with uncertainty about a possible regulatory overhaul for money funds--are reasons to avoid using the funds for all but very-short-term parking of cash, financial advisers say.
Money funds are mutual funds that invest in very-short-term debt issued by governments and large corporations, and that strive to maintain a set $1 share price. The average yield on taxable money funds for individual investors is just 0.01% a year, according to Crane Data LLC of Westborough, Mass. On an investment of $10,000, that is $1 a year.
Such low yields are unlikely to climb soon, as many market professionals think there is still too much economic uncertainty for the Federal Reserve to start raising short-term rates. Moreover, the reason money funds have been able to offer any yield at all in recent years is that management companies have been waiving billions of dollars in fees."

U.S. consumer prices rose just 1.2% in November from a year earlier, according to Labor Department data released Tuesday. The subdued price data came as the Fed opened a two-day policy meeting at which the fate of its $85 billion-a-month bond-buying program -- an effort to hold down long-term interest rates and drive up the value of homes, stocks and other assets -- is a central focus.
Meanwhile, annual inflation in the euro zone was 0.9% in November, the European Union's statistics office said Tuesday. And central banks in Sweden and Hungary cut interest rates, the latest efforts elsewhere in Europe to boost struggling economies as inflation remains low.
The downward pressure on prices presents a conundrum for policy makers across advanced economies: Should they respond with even easier monetary policy or dismiss it as a temporary development?
Central bankers worry about inflation falling too low because it raises the risk of deflation, or generally falling prices, a phenomenon that is difficult to combat through monetary policy. Some economists believe weak or falling prices can lead consumers to delay major purchases, exacerbating an economic slowdown. Even without deflation, very low inflation can be a sign of weak demand that weighs on wages, corporate profits and growth."

Orders to manufacturers for durable goods -- items intended to last more than three years, such as cars, appliances or heavy machinery -- sank 6.2% in March to the lowest level since August 1987, the Commerce Department reported. The drop, the third in a row, followed declines of 0.2% in February and 2.0% in January, and left orders 15.4% below a year earlier.
""Today's orders are tomorrow's production,"" said Stuart Hoffman, economist with PNC Financial Corp., a Pittsburgh bank holding company. ""So I think this signals that production and jobs {in manufacturing} will be down in the second quarter.""
The majority of economists believe the economy will turn around and grow slightly in the second period, according to the Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a survey of business economists and consulting groups. And some sectors of the economy, such as housing, have shown signs of bottoming out. But the durable-goods report was strong evidence for those who believe that the recovery may be a few months further down the road and that growth won't restart until the third quarter.
""This puts to rest the notion that with the end of the war came the end of the recession,"" said Nancy Sidhu, an economist with Security Pacific National Bank. Ms. Sidhu pointed in particular to a 10.3% slide in orders for nondefense capital goods, closely watched as a barometer of the industrial sector's investment and production plans."

Stock prices started higher from the opening after a report that factory orders for durable goods fell more than expected in March. The weak economic report raised hopes again that the Federal Reserve would be encouraged to spur the economy by cutting rates soon.
But the market's advance quickly evaporated after Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee that inflation is more worrisome now than it was in 1986.

Financial officers have little to fear but the Fed itself.
Investors around the world spent the past few weeks fretting about whether the Federal Reserve will try to nip rising inflation in the bud by raising interest rates in late June. With an increase in the federal-funds rate next week to 5.25% now looking like a certainty, the focus in the days ahead shifts to whether the Fed will signal yet another increase in its benchmark interest rate in August.
A slew of economist reports out over the weekend say it is a distinct possibility that the federal-funds rate later this summer will hit 5.5%, the line in the sand for many chief financial officers."

***
The latest evidence is yesterday's disappointing report of 1.8% in first quarter GDP. At this stage of recovery after a deep recession, the economy is typically growing by 4% or more as consumer confidence returns and businesses accelerate investment as their profits revive. Yet in this recovery consumers are still cautious and business investment remains weak.
Some of the first quarter's growth slump is due to seasonal factors such as bad weather and weaker defense spending. In the silver lining department, the private economy grew faster than the overall GDP figure because government spending declined. But even maintaining the 2.9% growth rate of 2010 would mark an historic underachievement for a recovery after a recession that was as deep as the one from late 2007 to mid-2009.
The most recent recession of comparable depth and job loss was in 1981-1982, when unemployment hit 10.8%. Huge chunks of industrial America shut down and never re-opened. Yet once the recovery began in earnest in the first quarter of 1983, the economy boomed. As the nearby table shows, growth exceeded 7.1% for five consecutive quarters, and it kept growing at nearly a 4% pace for another two years. Growth didn't dip below 2% in any quarter until the second three months of 1986. This was the Reagan boom."

Still, outside of the financial sector, the economy didn't feel any ripple effects until around mid-1989, notes Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Asset Management.
The 1987 market plunge was steeper than any of the market slides that have coincided with recessions in the past few decades.

February's budget gap compared with a surplus of $19.27 billion in January. The government often shows a surplus in December and January, in line with tax payment cycles.
In its statement, the Treasury said receipts totaled $89.35 billion last month, compared with $82.54 billion a year earlier and $142.92 billion in January. Outlays totaled $133.64 billion last month, compared with $120.90 billion a year earlier and $123.65 billion in January.

The disclosure by the Congressional Budget Office of new projections showing the federal deficit rising to $198 billion in 1989 also caused big ripples across the Atlantic.
The Financial Times of London gave its account of the CBO's revised projection the lead position on its front page. Since most U.S. newspapers did not give the story such treatment, why does it attract this attention in Europe?
Here this new projection looks like a body blow to the monetary strategy that Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III has been pursuing for the past six months. Baker has been skillfully buying time, waiting for the expected improvement in the trade and budget deficits to blunt protectionist pressures at home.
The sense of the deficits turning around was also supposed to encourage Japan and West Germany to take increasingly larger steps to lead international growth and help out the U.S. economy.
Baker had relied heavily on the CBO's original prediction that the deficit would come down to $161 billion by 1989. Throughout the spring and early summer, he assured the Europeans and Japanese that the United States was making significant progress in curbing its financial profligacy. Cutting $40 billion out of the deficit, he said in conferences in Paris and Venice, was nothing to sneeze at."

Corporate junk bonds leaped 20% in the first half, says Merrill Lynch & Co. Bonds convertible into common stock rose 15%. Both types of bonds threw off the doldrums of 1990, when they had full-year declines of more than 4%.
But Treasurys, municipals and other government bonds rose only 2.3% to 4.2% during the first half, using Merrill's yardstick of total return, or price changes plus interest payments.
That's not the way the bond market is supposed to behave during an economic slump. The conventional thinking among economists held that the recession would bring down interest rates, wring out inflation and trigger a bond market rally, sending prices of Treasury bonds sharply higher. Junk bonds had been expected to slide further, dragged down by declining corporate profits and rising bond default rates.
Instead, junk is starring, and safety is boring."

In Friday's Labor Department report for November, the U.S. unemployment rate fell to 7.7% from 7.9% in October, but mainly because another 350,000 workers disappeared during the month.
Call it the case of the missing workers. In the last year, employers have added an average of about 150,000 workers a month. In November they added 146,000, less 49,000 in downward revisions for the previous two months. Hiring grew at a healthy pace in professional services, leisure and hospitality, while falling slightly in construction and manufacturing.
Yet even as payrolls are rising, albeit slowly, the overall labor participation rate has continued to fall. In November, the share of the available labor force that is working fell to 63.6%, which is down from 65.7% when the recession ended in June 2009.
Mull that one over: Three years into an economic expansion, the labor participation rate has fallen two full percentage points and three times this year (including November) it has reached the lowest level since 1981. This means that about three million more workers were working or looking for work in 2009 than in November. In the last year alone, the number of working age nonworkers grew to 89.2 million from 86.8 million.
So why are more Americans sitting on the labor market sidelines even as job opportunities expand?

Would the late Milton Friedman have endorsed the Federal Reserve's plan to make large-scale purchases of long-term Treasury bonds? The idea here is to pump more money into and thus jump-start the economy, reducing unemployment. Some people, including this newspaper's David Wessel in a column last week, believe the great Nobel laureate would favor this inflationary program. I am certain he would not.
Friedman's main message for central banks was to maintain a monetary rule that kept the growth of the money supply constant. In his Newsweek column, ""Inflation and Jobs"" (Nov. 12, 1979), for example, Friedman emphasized that ""unemployment is . . . a side effect of the cure for inflation,"" so that if a central bank ""cured"" unemployment by inflating, it ""will have unemployment later."" In other words, don't try it.
Friedman's Newsweek column for July 28, 1980 (""Improving Monetary Policy"") came with the unemployment rate rising past 7%. His proposals for improving policy made no mention of using monetary expansion to reduce unemployment. He proposed rules for stable growth to achieve target ""dollar levels of monetary aggregates.""
Friedman served on President Reagan's economic policy advisory board. His memos on monetary policy repeat the themes he made familiar to Newsweek readers and others all over the world. There is not a word suggesting that monetary policy should try to raise the inflation rate in order to reduce the unemployment rate."
842614125,has-the-bull-just-been-sleeping?,wsj_398054037,1988-10-10,"Most commentators have concluded that stock prices were so high in August that they inevitably brought about a crash that ended the bull market. The price-earnings ratio was 22.1, certainly high. But compare prices at the end of other bull markets: for instance, in 1961 the Dow Jones P-E reached 24.2. The Dow then climbed another 32% in the next four years after a falloff of its own in 1962.
And looking at the Dow Jones does not tell the whole story. In August 1987 it happened that many of the Dow stocks were those with the highest P-Es. But this has not always been the case in the past. In 1969 when the Dow had a P-E of 17, IBM (not then in the Dow) was 42 times earnings, Xerox was at 48 times, Avon 57 times, and Polaroid was actually at 71 times its earnings. Did August even begin to compare?
Another important method of telling whether the stock market is overpriced is to compare the total value of stocks with the nominal gross national product. At the August peak the value of stocks was 95% of GNP. This is high, but at the 1929 market peak it was 170% of GNP. For the market to have been that high in August, the Dow would have been at 4,627.
Another method of determining how high prices are is to take a previous high and adjust it for inflation. In 1966 the Dow hit an intra-day high of 1,001. Adjusting that figure for inflation today gives approximately 3,540, or a full 30% above the August peak.
Thus three significant stock-price indicators show that prices were not so high in August that the bull market had to come to an end. But the reasons to doubt the current bear-market consensus go beyond that line of analysis."

Also, the sheer size of the dollar's fall this week -- more than seven pfennigs since Friday -- may force central banks to pause to let the market digest the tumble, or their tactics could backfire, traders said.

But the selloff only put a dent in the sharp run-up in bond prices this week.

That was the biggest weekly decline since December 2008 when Treasury prices soared on the financial crisis.
The benchmark 10-year note was 27/32 lower to yield 1.810%. The 30-year bond was 1 28/32 lower to yield 2.872%. The two-year note was 1/32 lower to yield 0.214%.
Some traders were quick to claim that it was a sign that a correction is due for the ferocious strength over the past seven months. The benchmark 10-year yield has tumbled from this year's peak of 3.77% in February and earlier Friday touched a fresh historic low of 1.672%.
Demand for safe-haven Treasurys had intensified this month due to rising fears about the global economy and the euro-zone's debt crisis. The Federal Reserve's announcement earlier this week to sell $400 billion short-dated bonds to buy longer-dated Treasurys triggered more flight into the 10-year and 30-year Treasurys.

The trade deficit is a case study in the unintended consequences of easy money.
The Commerce Department releases April trade data Wednesday morning. Economists think the deficit widened a bit, to $29 billion, from $27.6 billion in March. That would end an eight-month streak of narrower deficits that has cut the gap roughly in half, thanks first to a surge in exports and then to tumbling oil prices.
A narrower trade deficit is potentially good economic news on several fronts. For one, from an accounting perspective, exports add to gross domestic product, while imports subtract from it. From a fundamental standpoint, it is often healthier for a country to export more than it imports -- though collapsing imports can also signal weak demand at home, as they have in this recession.
Here's where the unintended consequences of fighting that recession come in: The money being pumped into the economy by the Federal Reserve has made some investors anxious about inflation, sometimes defined as the result of too much money chasing too few goods."

""It was just inevitable we would reach some level where there were just no more buyers and the sellers would gain the advantage,"" said Bob Giordano, chief dealer at Bank Leumi Trust Co. in New York.

Douglas Wilder told legislative leaders today that Virginia is coming out of the recession slower than the rest of the nation, and as evidence said that tax collections for the current budget year are projected to be $151 million less than expected just six months ago.
The governor said one member of his Advisory Council on Revenue Estimates called it a ""stealth recovery - so slow it would be difficult to see.""
Because of a previous agreement with the legislature, Wilder told the legislature's three money committees that he would use most of his $200 million rainy-day fund to make up for the shortfall, rather than further cutting programs and jobs.
The one bit of good news that Wilder offered today was that he would support an additional $15 million for local school aid.
Wilder said his economic advisers predict that the state ""will continue to under-perform the national economy in housing construction, consumer spending and employment growth"" during the next 11 months.

They maintain that there are some very good reasons why the so-called risk premium that investors expect to receive when they put money into stocks has been shrinking in recent years.
Academics usually define the ""equity risk premium"" as the extra return investors demand for holding stocks instead of less-risky government bonds. Although the premium can be measured a number of ways, most experts agree that it has declined substantially in recent years, contributing to the stock market's climb to its highest prices relative to earnings in decades.
In testimony to Congress Wednesday, Mr. Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said investors' optimism about strong profits has led to lower risk premiums in the stock and bond markets and warned of ""unwarranted expectations.""

Congress put through the tax, and there was a reversal of fiscal policy that produced a $3.1 billion surplus in fiscal 1969, a stunning change from a deficit of $25.2 billion in fiscal 1968. Taking the two years together, that was a net toughening of fiscal policy by $28.3 billion.
But we know now that it didnâ€™t, even with an extension of the surplus to a projected $5.9 billion in fiscal 1970.

However, the Treasury auction was the most oversubscribed in years, with bids received almost three and one-half times the amount of securities sold. Some analysts were surprised by the high level of demand, given widespread worries that many investors, such as institutional buyers from Japan, might have better investment opportunities at home.
Robert Brusca, chief economist for Nikko Securities International, estimated that Japanese investors, reportedly urged on by their central bank, purchased 30 percent to 40 percent of the notes. He cautioned, however, that they may have much less interest in the 10-year notes the Treasury will sell today and the 30-year bonds they will offer tomorrow. Both are also $10-billion issues.
""It looks great ... it feels rotten,"" Brusca said. ""We get a sense the Japanese ... bought the safest thing they could buy, which is the three-year note. It's a dark lining to a silver cloud.""

Whipsawed by sky-high fuel prices, lower fares and a glut of seats, nine of the 10 biggest carriers by traffic are expected to report fourth-quarter losses. Five did so last week.
Distressed airlines typically pin their survival hopes on huge savings from worker concessions. But slashing rank-and-file paychecks creates a management conundrum. Union members want senior executives to share their financial pain. Indeed, the prior heads of Delta Air Lines and AMR Corp. got forced out partly due to union ire over executive sacrifices perceived as inadequate. Yet further curbs on the compensation of the airlines' top brass could push even more of them out of the executive suite.
""It's a real tough dilemma,"" says Kim Cameron, a University of Michigan management professor. While profitability and stock prices usually rise when leaders share their subordinates' pay pain, pressure to pinch executive pay harder could weaken carriers' chances for recovery by increasing the tempo of management turnover.
""If you pay below market, you get what you pay for,"" says a former vice president of a troubled major carrier who joined a start-up airline earlier this month. ""You will be left with the 'B' team.""
As it now stands, virtually no upper-management wallet at sick airlines remains untouched, but the extent of slimmed compensation varies by carrier. Delta's chief executive officer, Gerald Grinstein, skipped his $500,000 annual salary for six months last year. And since he became head of the Atlanta airline in January 2004 (after having been a Delta board member), Mr. Grinstein has taken no other remuneration."

But lower interest rates work only if they induce consumers and businesses to borrow -- and then spend -- more. And since the Fed began cutting rates, the growth in business borrowing has ground to a halt, and consumer-credit growth has slowed sharply. Only home mortgage lending is still growing at a healthy pace, and even that has taken a hit in the wake of the terrorist attack."

That's not to say a recession is desirable. The heavy debt burdens of U.S. companies and Third World nations, as well as the continued weakness of the banking system, raise fears that a recession now would quickly snowball into financial disaster.
Nor does a recession appear imminent. At the moment, most indicators point to an economy that is picking up, not sputtering out.
But the stubborn intransigence of the trade figures, despite Treasury Secretary James Baker's policy to devalue the dollar, suggests no other medicine may be strong enough. The monthly merchandise trade gap set new records in June and July, hitting $15.7 billion and then $16.5 billion. That rise partly reflects seasonal distortions in the statistics; but at best, the trade trend is flat.
""I've been looking for improvement and haven't seen it, and I'm beginning to get discouraged,"" says Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Charles Kindleberger. ""This may mean we have to have a recession"" before the deficit numbers are reversed."

The sudden rise in the dollar's value during New York trading stirred rumors that the Federal Reserve had intervened on behalf of the U.S. currency. But traders at many commercial banks with which the Fed regularly deals said they saw no intervention by the central bank yesterday.

The dollar's decline this year has been unrelenting. It has fallen 5% against the pound, 7% against the yen, 10% against the euro and 14% against the Canadian dollar. Against the Federal Reserve's trade- weighted basket of currencies, the dollar has dropped 8%.
For years, most economists have viewed the dollar as an accident waiting to happen. To finance its huge trade deficit, the U.S. has been borrowing heavily from the rest of the world. The thinking was that overseas savers eventually would tire of holding ever-greater quantities of dollar-based assets. When they'd had enough, the dollar would fall.
And so it has. Many economists think the dollar will weaken further. Maurice Obstfeld of the University of California at Berkeley and Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard University calculated in 2005 that with the broadest measure of the U.S. trade deficit -- the current account -- running at more than 6% of the nation's economic output, the dollar needed to fall as much as 30% against the Fed's currency basket to bring the trade deficit back into balance. (A weaker dollar makes U.S. exports cheaper to foreigners and makes imports costlier for Americans, shrinking the trade gap, as has been happening lately.)
By that reckoning, the dollar needs to drop an additional 20%. And the Fed's new openness to cutting interest rates, if the textbooks are right, should further weaken the currency as global investors flock to places with higher returns."

NEW YORK -- The dollar failed to stage much of a comeback against the euro yesterday, ahead of a Federal Reserve rate-setting meeting, hurt by indications that U.S. industrial production is growing at a slower pace than anticipated.
Meanwhile, the Swedish krona fell sharply following a vote by Swedes to resoundingly reject membership of European Monetary Union, although it recouped some of its losses. Late yesterday in New York, the euro was trading at 9.1439 kronor, sharply higher than 9.0760 kronor late Friday, but well below the 9.20 kronor it had reached on the back of the rejection.
Observers said the result illustrates the gap between the goals and visions of the E.U.'s political and business elite on one hand and the mindset of their constituents on the other.
In the major currencies, the dollar was able to extend its gains modestly against the yen, as investors remain wary of currency-market intervention after the seemingly heavy presence of the Bank of Japan, which acts on behalf of the government, last week. Japan has been a dominant force in currency markets this year as it seeks to stop the yen from hitting 115 yen, a level thought to be the pain threshold for many exporters."

December's merchandise trade deficit, the Commerce Department said, narrowed to $6.3 billion from November's $7.4 billion, largely because of a decline in oil imports. But Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said he expected the 1984 deficit to widen further, with imports exceeding exports by perhaps $100 billion.
The effect of these trade woes has been widespread, even extending to industries where the U.S. traditionally has had an edge over foreign competitors -- such as telecommunications and machinery. David Ernst, vice president of Evans Economics here, says the deficit cost the U.S. 1.5 million jobs in 1983.
The main reason the deficit is so large, most economists agree, is the high value of the dollar, which has risen some 30% against other major currencies since 1980. That makes U.S. exports more expensive overseas and foreign goods cheaper in the U.S. As a result, ""American firms have a 30% cost disadvantage in world markets,"" complains Jack Albertine, who heads a trade association of medium-size, fast-growth companies called the American Business Conference.
The dollar's high value results primarily from high inflation-adjusted interest rates, which attract foreign savings to this country, according to the conventional analysis. High interest rates, in turn, are caused partly by the government's mammoth budget deficits."

""Analogies to the economics of office buildings are evident,"" Greenspan said. ""Few office buildings would be constructed in the absence of the ability to reach long-term leases. Short-term rental agreements are no more conducive to new office construction than spot prices for electric power are to the building of new power plants."" A copy of the text was released in Washington.
California's energy problems appear to be easing, but they still represent a ""worrisome situation for Californians, certainly,"" Greenspan said.

Fortunately, the overall effects on the California economy, and on those of its neighboring states, seems to have been modest, at least to date.""
Greenspan noted that large increases in the cost of gasoline and other petroleum products, natural gas, and electricity have hurt the U.S. economy in several ways. The most significant is the reduced profitability of non-energy firms, which has forced many companies to reduce spending for new plants and equipment.
""As best we can infer, a substantial part of the rise in the total costs of corporations between the second quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year reflected higher energy costs, only a small part of which companies apparently were able to pass through into higher prices"" of the things they sell, he said."

Obama and Boehner had been trying to package a deal that would reduce future federal deficits by $4 trillion over 10 years, a level S&P officials had suggested would be sufficient to avoid a downgrade. A lower credit rating would raise borrowing costs not just for the government, but also for consumers and businesses, which could slow U.S. economic growth. It also could lower the value of Treasury securities held as assets by banks, pension funds, mutual funds, hedge funds, and other investors around the world, potentially shaking financial markets.
Now that the large-scale talks have broken down, policy makers will likely pursue a smaller-scale deal that falls short of S&P's targets. Mr. Obama alluded to this possibility Friday evening.
""If we can't come up with a serious plan for actual deficit and debt reduction, and all we're doing is extending the debt ceiling for another six, seven, eight months, then the probabilities of downgrading U.S. credit are increased, and that will be an additional cloud over the economy and make it more difficult for us and more difficult for businesses to create jobs that the American people so desperately need,"" Mr. Obama said Friday evening."

But the widely anticipated decisionâ€”already employed as a catalyst for several recent ralliesâ€”left the rest of the stock market mixed and little changed in another sluggish summer session.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 21.82 points to close at 5721.26. It was the third straight gain for the blue-chip measure, which has crept back within striking distance of its all-time high of 5778.00, reached May 22.
The Dow was led upward by such companies as chemical maker DuPont and aluminum producer Alcoa, which suffer tire most when borrowing becomes more expensive, slowing spending on bigger purchases such as cars and houses.
But stable-demand consumer stocks such as Procter & Gamble and Merck, which had benefited most from the economic uncertainties confronting investors, were the Dowâ€™s weakest issues. And the Standard & Poorâ€™s 500-stock index of large companies, which usually moves in sync with the Dow, slipped 0.89 to 665.69, pressured by its heavier weighting with consumer-related businesses."

The Commerce Department reported that consumer spending rose by a robust 0.8% in August from July, following a 0.9% increase the month before. The latest figures pointed to a remarkably strong 7.4% annualized gain in inflation-adjusted consumer spending through the first two months of the third quarter, according to Bear Stearns estimates. If that spending pace was sustained through September -- final data won't be available until next month -- it would be the largest quarterly spending increase since 1985.
""Massive tax relief has boosted disposable income and real consumer spending,"" Steven Wood, an economist with Insight Economics, said in a note to clients. ""This fiscal stimulus will provide a strong boost to third-quarter"" growth.
It is still too early to say whether the latest spurt of spending will be sustainable. Consumer-confidence surveys remain soft, in part because companies haven't started hiring en masse, and that is restraining wages and salaries. Some economists warn that the recent jump in spending will wane as the initial impetus of tax cuts wears off. However the latest reports suggest the tax cuts at least helped set the tone for a summer of sizzling consumer spending.

Mr. Greenspan also focused on new risks to the economic outlook, specifically high housing prices. In a report released yesterday, the Fed said the value of all U.S. housing climbed 15% in the first quarter from a year earlier, and mortgage debt rose 13%, both easily outstripping the 6% gain in after-tax income over the same period.
""The soft readings on the economy observed in the early spring"" did not presage ""a more-serious slowdown,"" Mr. Greenspan told Congress's Joint Economic Committee. Though there have been periods of weakness during the expansion, they are ""backing and filling. . . . Instead of the economy going very smoothly forward it goes in little cycles. And hence, it's often misread as though we're about to tilt into a recession.""

The Fed has raised its target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, to 3% in eight quarter-point steps from 1% last June. Mr. Greenspan didn't address future rate moves, but quoted from the Fed's May 3 statement that interest rates would likely continue to rise at a ""measured"" pace. That has come to mean a quarter point per meeting. His commentary suggested that the Fed, contrary to recent speculation, probably will raise rates at least a few more times."

The results follow the strong showing of bellwether Intel Corp., which Tuesday announced quarterly profit that nearly quadrupled on a 44% jump in sales.
The trio of results kicks off what is likely to be a strong earnings streak as tech spending by companies and consumers picks up. Next week, Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp., among others, are slated to report quarterly results. Tech-research firm ISI Group projects that overall revenues from such companies will rise more than 10% for the first quarter, compared with a 16% decline a year earlier. Meanwhile, Standard & Poor's forecasts a 79% increase in tech earnings for the quarter from year-ago levels.
The growth has reached a level where tech companies are pushing to hire again, in some cases engaging in heated competition for talent. That's a turnabout for the industry, which had a series of layoffs last year, when some tech giants, notably Microsoft Corp., had mass layoffs for the first time.
The hiring ramp-up began late last year, with demand for tech goods and services stabilizing after months of declines.

Most economists concede that a lasting general recovery is unlikely without a recovery in the housing market. A marked increase in defaults and foreclosures from today's already elevated levels could produce losses that overwhelm banks and trigger another, deeper financial crisis. Study after study has shown that defaults go up when falling prices put mortgage holders ""underwater."" As a result, the trajectory of home prices has tremendous economic significance.
Earlier this year market observers breathed easier when national prices stabilized. But the ""robo-signing""-induced slowdown in the foreclosure market, the recent upward spike in home mortgage rates, and third quarter 2010 declines in the Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller home-price index--including very bad October numbers reported this week--have sparked concerns that a ""double dip"" in home prices is probable. A longer-term view of home price trends should sharply magnify this fear.
Even those economists worried about renewed price dips would be unlikely to believe that the vicious contractions of 2007 and 2008 (where prices fell about 30% nationally in just two years) could return. But they underestimate how distorted the market had become and how little it has since normalized.
By all accounts, the home price boom that began in January 1998, when the previous 1989 peak was finally surpassed, and topped out in June 2006 was extraordinary. The 173% gain in the Case-Shiller 10-City Index (the only monthly data metric that predates the year 2000) in those nine years averaged an eye-popping 19.2% per year. As we know now, those gains had very little to do with market fundamentals, and everything to do with distortionary government policies that set off a national mania for real-estate wealth and a torrent of temporarily easy credit."

""The chance of negative second-quarter gross domestic product rises as trade worsens,"" said Joseph Liro, chief economist of S.G. Warburg & Co. in New York. Gross domestic product is the value of goods and services produced in the U.S.
The widening trade gap was attributed to an increase in imports of computers, cars and other consumer goods and a decline in exports of telecommunications equipment and industrial supplies.
Although the trade surplus with Japan actually improved slightly -- narrowing to $5.87 billion in April from $6.14 billion the month before -- imports of new Japanese cars to the U.S. grew to $2.4 billion. That was the second-highest figure on record and a point that is certain to put additional pressure on the Clinton administration to keep a tough stance in its battle to force Japan to open its markets to American-made autos and auto parts. Washington has threatened to impose big tariffs on Japanese luxury cars starting June 28 unless an agreement with Japan is hammered out this week in Geneva.

Civilian unemployment fell to 7.5% of the work force in May after sticking at 7.8% in March and April, the Labor Department said. A separate measure, which includes members of the military among the employed, dropped to 7.4% in May from 7.7%.
The drop returned the jobless rate to its level of November 1980, when Ronald Reagan was elected president. Any further declines in the coming months will enable the president to claim during his reelection campaign that his administration brought down both inflation and unemployment.
But the decline of the unemployment rate is more a reflection of the economy's previous strength than of its strength in May. While employment rose sharply during the month, the number of hours worked by the average employee declined from the unusually high level of April, and average earnings also declined. That suggests industrial production and personal income rose modestly in May, if at all.

The Fed minutes of its March 13 policy-setting committee meeting showed agreement that the U.S. economic recovery had strengthened moderately, but left investors to question the Fed's appetite for launching additional bond buying, or other programs, to shore up growth and whether the rally can continue without a prime driver.
""One of the things underpinning the rally has been Fed's easy-money policy, and this could be seen as the Fed moving to close off the liquidity spigot to some extent,"" said Etai Friedman, head of equity derivatives trading MKM Partners.
While Fed officials said they are prepared to buy or sell assets ""as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery,"" the minutes didn't show widespread agreement for doing so anytime in the immediate future."

Combined with Tuesday's producer price index, which showed a decline in core wholesale prices, the data point to a drop in inflation pressures. That would allow the Fed to stop raising rates, which would otherwise threaten economic growth and cramp corporate profits.
The housing market showed more signs of slowing, which could also motivate the Fed to maintain its position on rates. Housing starts fell to an annualized rate of 1.795 million in July, down from 1.85 million in June. The number of building permits issued likewise fell."

NEW YORK -- The dollar fell Friday after a softer-than-expected September core-inflation reading and generally weak U.S. data.
In volatile morning trading, the dollar tumbled as the data were released, briefly bounced back and then fell to fresh session lows by midday. In the end, the dollar was far off the two-year high it tapped Thursday against the yen, while the euro gained more than a cent from its session low and briefly topped $1.21.
In late New York trading, the euro was at $1.2087, up from $1.2033 late Thursday. The dollar sank to 114.01 yen from 114.32 yen and to 1.2834 Swiss francs from 1.2877 francs. The pound was fetching $1.7699, up from $1.7563.
Although overall consumer prices rose 1.2% in September, the core number -- excluding food and energy -- rose just 0.1%. A 0.2% rise in retail sales in September also put pressure on the dollar; a 0.4% increase had been expected.

The price report came as the Commerce Department released its final calculation of the country's third-quarter economic growth, confirming that the economy during the period expanded at its slowest pace since the end of 1986.
The department estimated that the gross national product, the market value of all the goods and services produced in the U.S., grew at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 2.5% during the period. The figure was slightly lower than the previous estimate of 2.6%, a revision most economists said was insignificant.
On the surface, the two reports seemed to mitigate some fears that the economy is growing too rapidly to hold prices in line. The increase in consumer prices was lower than many analysts expected, and, to most, reinforced a Labor Department report Friday that showed wholesale prices in November rose only 0.3% as well.
Moreover, the third-quarter GNP expansion was significantly slower than in the first and second quarters, when GNP grew at 3.4% and 3.0% respectively."

Bond yields hit record lows again this week. Is it time to start positioning your portfolio for rising rates?
At first blush such a move might seem like portfolio suicide. The main drivers of rising interest rates--economic growth and inflation--are nowhere in sight. In fact, Treasury yields could fall further if the Federal Reserve starts buying bonds again in a widely anticipated maneuver known as ""quantitative easing.""
But step back from day-to-day market gyrations and a different picture emerges. Bond yields have fallen for most of the past three decades. A $1,000 investment in the U.S. government debt in 1980 would be worth about $12,970 today, according to the Ryan Labs Treasury Composite Index. Treasury prices, which move in the opposite direction of yields, have surged 9.3% this year alone.
Now consider a different era: 1949 through 1979. Over that 30-year span, a $1,000 initial investment in Treasurys would have turned into a far humbler $2,950. That's because yields soared during the period; by 1980 the yield on the 10-year Treasury had reached a record high of nearly 16%."

Prices of bonds backed by subprime mortgages have plunged as much as 25% since the New York Fed and investment manager BlackRock Solutions began in April selling off assets in a vehicle known as Maiden Lane II.

The New York Fed had moved to sell the crisis-era portfolio piecemeal after rejecting a $15.7 billion offer from AIG in March to buy all the assets. At the time, Maiden Lane II held securities with a face value of about $30 billion. The assets were moved onto the Fed's balance sheet during the financial crisis as part of its bailout of AIG.

Barring a war with Iraq -- which could crimp global crude-oil supplies to refineries -- prices should remain around $1.40 a gallon through December, Mr. Costello said.
Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico and other production problems drove up wholesale prices during October. In the Northeast, a shortage of methyl tertiary butyl ether, an additive used to reduce emissions and add octane to gasoline, put pressure on prices. MTBE prices jumped to $1.31 a gallon in October, compared with 70 cents last year, before falling to $1.10 a gallon this month.

Hensley cited exports to South Korea, which plunged to $1.096 billion in January from $1.680 billion the previous month. ""The level is all the way down to 1993 levels, so we've essentially given back in a few months about four years of export growth,"" he said.
Commerce Secretary William Daley agreed with that diagnosis, saying the crisis ""has taken its toll on our exports.""

In November, voters in two key battlegrounds, Nevada and Florida, will be asked to raise the minimum wage in their states. Those on both sides of the initiatives believe the measures could increase voter turnout among Democratic-leaning African-Americans, Hispanics and low- income workers -- and possibly boost Democratic nominee Sen. John Kerry's showing against President Bush.
The initiative drives have no formal connection to Mr. Kerry or the Democrats, and they come after 12 other states and Washington, D.C., already have established minimum wages higher than the federal rate. That figure, now $5.15 an hour, was last raised by Congress in 1997.
Democrats and their allies hope the measures can help mobilize core backers upset about the economy in the same way Republicans pick up support from initiatives important to their supporters. Polls suggest Democrats hold the high ground on economics this year, and pushing for a higher minimum wage provides an opportunity to spotlight their policies. Similarly, allies of the president have been pressing state initiatives to bar gay marriage in several electoral battlegrounds.
This year, polls show, weak job growth, the low pay of many newly created jobs and a widening gap between rich and poor are weighing on voters' minds. While many economists believe a higher minimum wage deters employment of low-skilled workers, the issue has wide political appeal, and even many business-friendly Republicans are loath to openly oppose an increase."

While lower U.S. rates usually mean a weaker dollar as the yield on dollar-denominated deposits declines, capital flows into the U.S. currency are increasing in line with gains in the U.S. stock market, said Joe Yuska, foreign-exchange manager at Banc One International in Dallas.
""There is nothing in the horizon that will trip up the dollar,"" said Mr. Yuska, who expects the euro could pass last week's low of $1.0785 to test $1.0680."

This movement threatens to obscure the nascent effort, just entering its third year, to help mothers break their complete dependency on welfare through work. It is an effort that could also save money, though that isnâ€™t its major purpose.
Because welfare developments donâ€™t get much public attention, many people may have missed or forgotten the striking series of changes in federal policy designed to reduce welfare rolls by encouraging work.
The seminal legislation was the bipartisan Family Support Act of 1988. This legislation provided states with several billion dollars over five years to pay for education, training, child care and other services intended to help mothers leave welfare for workâ€”including one year of health benefits and day care after leaving welfare.
Congress and Presidents Reagan and Bush have collaborated on several other pieces of legislation designed to help promote work. The 1986 tax reform bill eliminated or dramatically reduced federal taxes for low-income workers. The bill also expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit, an earnings subsidy paid by the federal government to low-income working families with children. In 1990 Congress and President Bush expanded the EITC even more. By 1994, many working families will be eligible for up to $2,400 in cash wage supplements.
We have also strengthened the nationâ€™s child support enforcement program, expanded federal support for day care and broadened government support for health insurance, all on a bipartisan basis."

While a number of indicators show credit markets are thawing, economists, central bankers and investors are paying keen attention to the rate at which foreign banks are pulling dollar deposits out of their U.S. branches. That pace has set records for several months, according to the latest data from the Treasury Department. The moves, analysts say, suggest banks still are scrambling for ways to finance investments in dollar-denominated securities such as U.S. mortgage-backed bonds.
Before the credit crisis hit in August 2007, foreign banks could freely borrow dollars from U.S. banks and one another. Bank affiliates also could sell short-term IOUs. Now banks are demanding bigger lending premiums for certain loans.
On the bright side, the banks' increased reliance on U.S. deposits is making them less dependent on central-bank lending programs, which were put in place as an emergency backstop. Still, it also demonstrates how brittle the lending markets remain. Until banks develop more trust among one another, even short-term borrowing rates will remain relatively expensive, making economic recovery more costly for businesses and individuals.
This has had an unexpected effect on the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, which is supposed to reflect the interest rates banks charge each other for loans. A large gap has appeared between the one-month and three-month Libor, in what analysts say is a worrying sign that banks remain reluctant to make longer-term loans to one another. As of Friday, three-month dollar Libor was 1.01%, 0.59 percentage point more than the rate on one-month loans. Historically the gap hovered close to zero."

With the latest layoffs, First Boston, a unit of closely held CS First Boston Inc., will have slashed its work force by 1,000 since the crash, through firings and attrition, First Boston officials said. The 200 layoffs are concentrated in the corporate, municipal and mortgage bond departments and the common and preferred stock units. These areas have been especially hard hit by rising interest rates and low trading volumes during the past 18 months.

The latest report showed that four years into the economic recovery, demand still remains too weak for firms to push prices higher and unemployment too high for workers to secure significantly higher wages.

In 1981, the Reagan administration successfully pressed Congress to trim Title XX of the Social Securities Act, a program that helped focus spending on child day care, home-based nursing and other social programs. The fix: Lump the money and turn it over to states as block grants with few strings attached.
But instead of leading to the renaissance supporters had pictured -- with savings and improved services -- the changes reduced funding and forced localities to trim some programs, social workers now say.
Welfare experts say the changes to Title XX provide one of the best parallels to reforms designed to end Aid to Families with Dependent Children. ""It's pretty much the purest form of block grant that people are talking about,"" said Michael Kharfen, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokesman.
One of the strings cut in Title XX was the requirement that states supplement federal grants with their own money. Some states responded by curbing spending. Dropping the requirement for state supplements paralleled the effects of inflation, so while the total federal block grants rose to $2.8 billion last year, the grants' value has fallen by 58 percent since 1977, according to a House Ways and Means Committee report."

The decision yesterday by seven European central banks to lower key interest ratescapped a 10-day period during which European governments announced a steady stream of fiscal and monetary measures aimed at spurring economic growth. The actions, which Baker strongly urged, raised hopes that the Treasury chief will soon engineer an international agreement designed to check the dollar's precipitous fall, hold down interest rates and avert worldwide recession.
Such an agreement, in turn, could bolster Baker's hopes of keeping the economy afloat during the 1988 election campaign, with obvious benefits for the Republican side.
But many economists caution that Baker's initiatives won't fundamentally alter the global economy's underlying problems. In their view, Baker appears to be obtaining only modest progress toward shrinking the huge U.S. budget and trade deficits and the need to borrow vast sums of money from abroad.

The Conference Board's consumer confidence index has declined for three straight months. In March, 30 percent of respondents said jobs are ""plentiful""; now that's only 24 percent. All this inspires much foreboding, because a recession is widely regarded as a calamity or something close to it.
Just last week, the Federal Reserve cut its key overnight interest rate for the second time since August. It now stands at 4.5 percent, down from its recent peak of 5.25 percent. Although the economy grew at a strong 3.9 percent annual rate in the third quarter, most economists regard this as an aberration. They expect slower growth or a recession, because three powerful forces are assaulting the economic expansion.
First, housing. Its collapse deepens. Economist Richard Berner of Morgan Stanley notes that sales of new and existing homes have dropped 42 percent and 30 percent, respectively, from their peaks of more than two years ago. As supplies of unsold homes grow, real estate prices continue to fall. One index finds that prices in August were down 4.4 percent nationally from a year earlier.
Second, oil prices. They're approaching $100 a barrel. Even before the latest price increases, energy costs rose to 6.2 percent of consumer spending in the second quarter; that's up from 4.5 percent in 2002, notes consultant Jack Lavery, a former chief economist of Merrill Lynch. Higher energy costs will continue to weaken purchasing power for other goods and services, he says.
Third, credit problems. As lenders and investors have suffered losses on subprime mortgages -- loans to weaker borrowers -- they've tightened lending standards for other borrowers. With the economy slowing, Diane Vazza of Standard & Poor's expects bond defaults to rise among shakier corporate borrowers, especially companies dependent on strong consumer spending (retailers, fast-food chains, entertainment firms)."

The Commerce Department said exports increased by 2.9% to $35.43 billion in September while imports rose by 3.2% to $42.22 billion. The August deficit was $6.53 billion.
The Bush administration hailed the news as an indication of economic recovery. ""The slight increase in the overall deficit reflected a growing U.S. economy, with strong purchases by Americans of consumer and capital goods,"" said Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher in a statement. ""With three quarters of 1991 in the bank, a very good trade year is shaping up.""
But several private economists suggested Mr. Mosbacher's analysis was overly optimistic, particularly on the import side. Bruce Steinberg, senior economist with Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York, said the growth in imports doesn't really reflect a pickup in consumer demand, but rather the purchase of previously ordered goods. ""Unfortunately, most of the increase in imports was in retail inventories, {orders made} when people thought the recession was over,"" said Mr. Steinberg.

In the course of their deliberations, which closely resemble an academic seminar, the Fed governors will take into account everything from the unexpectedly large increase in the April consumer price index to its benign follow-up in May to Japan's first-quarter growth. The probable result of all this activity: a rate hike of one-quarter of one percentage point.
Why so much attention to an event once known only to Fed watchers at investment banks? The reason has little to do with whether and by how much the Fed raises the rate, though this will of course have some bearing on the immediate direction of the markets. What really matters, however, is what the Fed's action suggests about its view of the future of inflation.
After decades in which mainstream economists held that the costs of inflation were negligible, and that an inflationary monetary policy could stimulate economic growth, it is now widely appreciated (thanks to the work of Milton Friedman, Robert Lucas, Martin Feldstein and others) that stable, low inflation is essential to longer expansions and stronger growth. Thus the intense speculation: Will tomorrow be the start of another ""long march,"" a 300 basis point increase such as began in 1988 and 1994 to ward off inflation? Is the Fed going to reverse the 75 basis point decrease in interest rates in response to the last year's global turmoil and the prospect of deflation?
The change in forecasts of what the Fed will and should do has been rapid. As recently as late February, the Economist magazine ran a cover story worrying about the risk of global deflation; a few weeks later it hawkishly editorialized that the Fed was late in raising interest rates. Behind these large swings in opinion lie some unresolved questions about the economy, among them:
-- Why has inflation continued to decelerate? Is it due to a string of one-time favorable ""shocks,"" such as low oil prices, a strong dollar, and a steeper than anticipated decline in computer prices? Has that string run out?"

The stock market has had a heady few weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has mustered above 11000 for the first time since April -- and it has managed to stay there through the early part of the third-quarter earnings season.
But the swift rise of the market -- the Dow is up about 10% from its Aug. 31 close -- comes against a backdrop of somewhat unsettling news. The jobless rate remains stuck just below 10% with little respite in sight. The housing market is still very weak, and is enduring further shocks as lenders' foreclosure problems keep getting worse. The political situation seems a bit chaotic. And the global recovery is uneven enough that the Federal Reserve is thinking of yet more extraordinary measures to get things rolling.
Even with those headwinds, the mood among stock investors as we near the end of October is surprisingly upbeat. Third-quarter earnings are coming in better than expected and optimism about the Fed's latest extraordinary plan -- quantitative easing part two, or QE2 -- is rampant in the stock market. We entered the dreaded September-October period in fear; we are leaving it with bliss breaking out.
Such sudden shifts in sentiment, especially with uncertainty on the rise, makes me a little queasy. Given the widespread gains, it might make sense to examine your portfolio now with an eye toward rebalancing, rather than wait for the end of the year. In so doing, you may want to pare back some of the bigger winners and salt away the gains for the coming year."

In 1980 the inventor, an animated fellow named Francis Vitagliano, shared his concept with an MIT professor, Franco Modigliani. The Italian-born economist had been writing for 20 years about his theory of how and when people spend and save money during their lifetime, the so-called Life-Cycle Hypothesis. Modigliani's work would win him the 1985 Nobel Prize in Economics, but the call from Vitagliano would, he thought, give him a way to test his theory in real life.
The men became champions for this new financial instrument, spending untold sums for a patent on the card idea, trying to sell it to banks and credit card companies, and withstanding a barrage of criticism from members of Congress and the financial community.
Franco Modigliani died last year at age 85. But tomorrow in Washington, Francis Vitagliano, now 55, is scheduled to watch as the 401(k) card is unveiled at a financial conference. Appearing on a panel will be an official of ING, the global financial services company that has licensed Patent No. 5206803 and is preparing to introduce the new card to employers and their k-plan participants soon, after receiving final regulatory approval from the state of Connecticut.

Last week, he gave a speech that used bold language to signal that Fed would cut interest rates to try to prevent a severe economic downturn. On Thursday, he told Congress how to design a stimulus package that would offer immediate help.

Some are asking if this is a definitive turning point for the bond market after its 30-year bull run. It isn't clear yet that global yields have hit bottom--but it is clear that bonds are becoming hypersensitive to the smallest twists and turns in the economy.
The turn in mood has been sharp. On May 2, after the European Central Bank cut rates and hinted that it might yet push the rate on its deposit facility into negative territory, 10-year German yields hit a record low around 1.15%; U.S. yields were at a low for the year of 1.63%. But since then, a better-than-expected U.S. jobs report, some encouraging German industrial data and a brewing debate about how and when the U.S. Federal Reserve might wind down its bond-purchase program have pushed yields sharply higher, to 1.36% in Germany and 1.92% in the U.S. Gilt yields have broadly tracked Treasurys.
But none of the data yet suggest an economy that is standing on firm ground: U.S. payrolls growth of 165,000 in April was better than expected, but hardly stellar, albeit prior months were also revised upward. Better data for Germany is welcome, but is unlikely to pull the euro zone as a whole out of its extended slump. Other indicators continue to suggest a soft patch. Most significantly, key measures of inflation have been falling, which should be bond-friendly: In the U.S., the core Personal Consumption Expenditure measure, the Fed's favored inflation gauge, has dropped to 1.1%, while euro-zone inflation is estimated at 1.2% in April, down from 1.7% in March. And since the start of May, the ECB, the Danish central bank, the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Reserve Bank of India, the National Bank of Poland and the Bank of Korea have all cut rates--between them accounting for some 23% of world GDP, notes Deutsche Bank.
Further falls in inflation may yet scotch talk of tapering bond purchases in the U.S. In the euro zone, the ECB may yet become more dovish. And the full effects of the Bank of Japan's new activism have yet to be seen--although Japanese net purchases of foreign bonds have now turned positive, another potential support for U.S. and European markets.
Still, the violence of May's selloff suggests that with yields at such low levels, investors are very sensitive to any data that goes against expectations and are very quick to try to judge what that means for central-bank policy. That means more volatility lies ahead. Investors should watch out."

To a veteran of the Reagan administration, all of this sounds pretty familiar. In 1981, shortly after the enactment of the Reagan tax cut, the economy slid into a serious recession. The tax cut, combined with the recession, resulted in a substantial deficit in 1982, and deficits ""as far as the eye could see"" thereafter.
Ronald Reagan's economic plan -- based on supply-side theory -- was a relatively new idea at the time, and the severe recession spread alarm through the political community. The deficits, it was thought, would bring back inflation, cause interest rates to rise, worsen the recession and slow or defer any recovery. The president was implored to back a tax increase, not just by the Democrats -- who wanted desperately to repeal or defer the tax cut -- but also by Republicans, who feared that the recession would decimate their ranks in the 1982 election.
Even members of the president's staff lost their nerve, with leaks from the White House complaining that Mr. Reagan would not listen to reason, and budget director David Stockman being quoted in a magazine article to the effect that Mr. Reagan didn't know what he was doing. Alone among the president's advisers, Treasury Secretary Donald Regan made the obvious point: It's absurd to raise taxes in the midst of a recession. Mr. Reagan, bless his stubborn heart, agreed with his treasury secretary and, as he put it, ""stayed the course.""
Sure enough, the economy didn't just recover -- it boomed. Despite the deficits, which did indeed continue at historic peacetime levels through Mr. Reagan's two terms in office, inflation and interest rates declined. The nation shook off the strange combination of slow growth and inflation that characterized the Carter years and grew at a healthy rate through the rest of the 1980s.

The politically sensitive U.S. deficit with China narrowed in February to $13.9 billion from January's $15.3 billion level. But critics of China pointed out that the combined figure for those two months was 47 percent above the same period last year and said the report will fuel growing sentiment in Congress for a tougher policy on Beijing's trade practices.
The overall gap was a record -- by itself nothing new, because the monthly trade deficit has smashed through previous highs eight times since the start of last year. But yesterday's report deepened concern that the flow of goods across U.S. borders does not seem to be responding to the dollar's fall, even though that decline has continued for three years.
A cheaper dollar is supposed to spur sales of U.S. exports by making American goods more attractive to foreign purchasers, and reduce Americans' appetite for foreign products by making them more expensive. Together with some private economists, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan predicted late last year that the move in the currency would start to exert an effect on trade flows and shrink the gap in months to come. So far, however, signs of such a development have been scant."

Despite the economy's stronger-than-expected growth, the forecasters are more optimistic about inflation than they were in previous surveys.

The president said he does not believe the size of the deficit is responsible for the high level of interest rates and noted that rates have fallen in the last two years even though the deficits have risen."

Looking for global hot spots? Try the Districtâ€™s Lorton Reformatory, which happens to be in the heart of the 8th, in southern Fairfax County.
Republican Rep. Stan Parris or his Democratic opponent, Del. David G. Brickleyâ€”thereâ€™s no argument about the fundamental premise of this year's 8th District election: all politics are local.
Parris, a former member of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, is hoping that his emphasis on parochial matters such as transportation and his tireless, sharp-tongued criticism of the District government will win him a sixth term.
The two are vying to represent a district that takes such matters seriously. Political activists say that the 8th, which comprises the southern half of Fairfax County, the eastern two-thirds of Prince William County, the northern half of Stafford County and the entire city of Alexandria, includes some of the countryâ€™s most informed, involved and independent voters."

Minutes of the Fed's July 30-31 policy meeting, released Wednesday, suggested officials were on track to start winding down the $85 billion-a-month bond-buying program, possibly as early as September, if the economy strengthens as they expect.
They were, however, a bit more uncertain than in June about whether economic growth would pick up as they forecast and about the gains they were seeing in the job market.
Reflecting the cautiousness shown in the minutes and their own uncertainty about how the economy will perform in the months ahead, some Fed officials have begun talking about making a small move when they do start pulling back on bond buying. ""If you're very uncertain about how strong the improvement in the economy is, and how self-sustaining, then you should move in fairly small increments,"" Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said in an interview Wednesday with The Wall Street Journal.
Mr. Rosengren, a strong supporter of the easy-money policies, said he was still forming a judgment about whether the economy was improving as expected. ""This is a good time to be patient and very watchful,"" he said."
