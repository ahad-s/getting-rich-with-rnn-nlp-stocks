As tablets and other mobile devices boost processing speeds, they require power supplies for low voltages and large current drives. They also require multi-application power supplies, and must also reduce noise to compensate for downsizing of PCBs.
Toshiba’s new multi-output system power IC offers a high efficiency, large current drive with 2-ch DC-DC converters, 4-ch serialized regulators for noise reduction, and 1-ch load switch. Each DC-DC converter drives with a different oscillation frequency, reducing the switching noise peak. The ability to change output voltage and the rising sequence through the I2C bus ensures the IC can support diverse applications.
ApplicationsInformation devices such as smartphones and tablets
Main FeaturesStep-down DC-DC converters (2 ch) + LDO (4 ch) + Load SW (1 ch)Configurations of output voltage and sequence through I2C busSmall package: QFN32 (5×5 mm)
