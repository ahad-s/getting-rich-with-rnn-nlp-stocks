STOCKHOLM--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
PubMatic, the automation solutions company for an open digital media industry, announced today that Mediekompaniet Adapt, a consortia of the major media houses that together offer a unique digital reach to the Swedish market, has chosen PubMatic’s Unified Ad Server to power their end-to-end ad serving. The addition of the Unified Ad Server complements Mediekompaniet Adapt’s existing use of PubMatic’s SSP platform and real-time-time analytics solutions.
Mediekompaniet Adapt began working with PubMatic in May 2015, initially adopting the company’s SSP technology to help drive their Real-Time Bidding (RTB) strategy. The partnership has evolved over the last 18 months to support the expansion of Mediekompaniet Adapt’s programmatic strategy, including programmatic direct and extensive private marketplace (PMP) monetization. The addition of the ad server will enable Mediekompaniet Adapt to implement a more holistic approach to ad decisioning across its various types of inventory.
“The integration of PubMatic’s Unified Ad Server is a natural next step for a partnership as robust as ours,” commented Anna Ireby, VD, Mediekompaniet Adapt. “PubMatic has been instrumental in helping us achieve our programmatic monetisation goals. Their willingness to develop solutions that meet our business needs allowed us to accelerate our programmatic strategy, and we’re currently tracking ahead of our initial success milestones.”
Jonas Olsen, PubMatic’s Regional Director for the Nordics, added, “At PubMatic, we pride ourselves on establishing meaningful working partnerships with our customers, delivering not only next-generation technology but also the exceptional service and account management normally only available through paid-for enterprise arrangements at other companies. This combination of tech and service ensures our ability to build the kind of deep, mutually beneficial relationships that we have with Mediekompaniet Adapt.”
PubMatic released its Unified Ad Server as part of its comprehensive revenue management platform, SEVEN, which launched in September 2016. SEVEN was developed to give publishers full control of their digital assets and provide media buyers with the ability to purchase verified audiences and premium inventory at scale across multiple revenue channels and ad formats.
"PubMatic is and always has been deeply invested in providing the technology that enables the future of publishing," said Bill Swanson, VP, EMEA, PubMatic. "We develop technology solutions that allow publishers to have control over their ad decisioning. That means they can focus on long-term strategies rather than short-term reactive tactics. By using SEVEN, Mediekompaniet Adapt can be confident that they have the tools they need to build a competitive advantage in today's complex ecosystem."
