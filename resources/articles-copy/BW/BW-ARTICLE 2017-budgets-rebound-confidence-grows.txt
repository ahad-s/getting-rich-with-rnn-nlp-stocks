Key highlights from the survey include:
IT Budgets Rebound With Focus on IT and Overall Operations
Ability to Satisfy Overall Organizational Demands at Three-Year High; Confidence Lessens Beyond Core IT
* Overall organizational demands comprise core IT and line of business demands
Organizational Alignment Remains a Top Challenge
Security, Cloud, Business Intelligence/Big Data and Mobility Will Continue to See Increased Investment, Yet Mobility Falls in Impact
Programmers and Developers Remain Most Critical Skill Set and Most Difficult to Find
*Positions that have been in the top five for three years running are bolded
*Positions that have been in the top five for three years running are bolded
Salaries and Hiring Will Continue to Rise, but at Slower Growth Rates
IT Staff Makeup Will Remain Consistent; Managed Services and Staff Augmentation Set to Increase
* Statement of work
“Overall the picture looks good for tech heading into 2017. Budgets are up and IT departments are expecting to be able to support overall organizational demands at a high level while also being able to support business growth,” says TEKsystems Research Manager Jason Hayman. “It appears that some of the heavy lifting in helping other departments realize some larger scale digital transformation is over and they can concentrate on preparing for the next stages of development within their organizations. This may contribute to the shift in more staff augmentation and managed services as a labor model, where they have the ability to control and have oversight on more of their application development and project management than before.”
TEKsystems’ Jason Hayman is available for additional commentary. For more information about the survey, or to schedule an interview, please contact Nathan Bowen at nabowen@TEKsystems.com.
