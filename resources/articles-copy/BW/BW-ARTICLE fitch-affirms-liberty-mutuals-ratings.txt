CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Fitch Ratings has affirmed Liberty Mutual Group Inc.'s (LMG) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB'. Additionally, Fitch has affirmed LMG's insurance operating subsidiaries' (collectively referred to as Liberty Mutual) Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) ratings at 'A-'. The Rating Outlook remains Positive for all ratings. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release.
KEY RATING DRIVERS
Fitch's rating actions follow LMG's announcement that the company will acquire 100% of Ironshore Inc. (Ironshore) from Fosun International Limited. The transaction, expected to close in the first half of 2017, poses near-term execution and integration risks that are somewhat mitigated by LMG's past acquisition experience. Ironshore's large market presence in U.S. excess & surplus (E&S) lines and history of positive underwriting performance will meaningfully expand LMG's specialty segment.
Liberty Mutual's Outlook was revised to Positive on Aug. 11, 2016 due to recent improvement in operating performance, which has historically lagged higher-rated peers. Liberty Mutual traditionally generates weaker underwriting results relative to peers, but this differential has moderately narrowed in recent years. LMG is currently meeting several upgrade triggers, and Fitch would likely upgrade the ratings if positive operating performance continues, LMG's financial leverage ratio falls below 28%, and the company maintains its 'Strong' Prism score.
Despite maintaining the Positive Outlook, a ratings upgrade is unlikely until financial ramifications of the transaction are revealed through actual combined reported operating performance. This places the earliest likelihood of an upgrade at early to mid-2018.
The affirmation of LMG's ratings are based on the company's established and sustainable positions in its chosen markets, benefits derived from the company's multiple distribution channels, adequate capitalization and financial performance.
Liberty Mutual will significantly increase its presence in the E&S market once the deal closes, moving from the 29th largest market participant to number seven on a pro forma basis based off of 2015 direct premiums written. Furthermore, Ironshore's reported five-year average combined ratio of 92.2% should contribute to Liberty Mutual's improving operating performance.
Mitigating these factors, LMG's balance sheet quality and capital strength will slightly deteriorate due to an expected increase in goodwill and debt. Given the $3 billion purchase price, which equates to 1.45x Ironshore's tangible book value at year-end 2016, the amount of goodwill generated will be roughly $930 million. This will add to LMG's already sizeable third quarter 2016 goodwill balance of $4.9 billion.
Financial leverage will likely also increase but more modestly, as Fitch believes most of the purchase funds will come from the sale of certain holding company investments and current holding company cash. LMG may issue debt to finance a portion of the deal; however, Fitch expects financial leverage will be maintained below 35% and should gradually decline following the purchase.
While Fitch views the purchase as a slight credit negative in the near-term due to inherent execution and integration risks present with any acquisition, successful execution of the acquisition and a commitment to reducing financial leverage post-acquisition could provide longer-term positive credit benefits to LMG's operating profile and rating prospects.
RATING SENSITIVITIES
Key rating triggers that could lead to an upgrade include:
--Maintenance of improved performance in underwriting results with a combined ratio of approximately 100% or better on both an accident and calendar year basis;
--A sustained Prism score of 'Strong' category or higher.
--Financial leverage ratio sustained below 28%.
--Continued favorable reserve development and stability in reserve position.
Key rating triggers that could result in a return to Stable Outlook include:
--A return to accident year underwriting losses;
--Material weakening in the company's current reserve position, potentially indicated by a unfavorable reserve development greater than 5% of prior year equity;
--Failure to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of 5.0x;
--A large acquisition that unfavourably changes the operating profile or is financed in a manner that adds balance sheet risk causing run-rate financial leverage to move to 30%, or peak at 35% or higher whether or not the company subsequently reduces leverage.

The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.
