LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Lundin Law PC, a shareholder rights firm, announces that it is investigating claims against Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Agios” or the “Company”) (AGIO) concerning possible violations of federal securities laws.
To get more information about this investigation, please contact Brian Lundin, Esquire, of Lundin Law PC, at 888-713-1033, or via email at brian@lundinlawpc.com.
The investigation focuses on whether Agios and certain of its officers and/or directors violated federal securities laws. Agios revealed updated data for its AG-348 and AG-519 molecules, which are used to treat pyruvate kinase deficiency, at the 2016 American Society of Hematology meeting. A report stated Grade 2 thrombocytopenia, which reduces platelets in blood cells, was found in a patient receiving AG-519, and that an ongoing severe adverse event of drug-related cholestatic hepatitis was noted in a bioavailability and food effect study after a dose of 300 mg. When this news was released to the public, the value of Agios declined as much as 15.85% on December 5, 2016, causing investors severe harm.
Lundin Law PC was founded by Brian Lundin, a securities litigator based in Los Angeles dedicated to upholding shareholders’ rights.
