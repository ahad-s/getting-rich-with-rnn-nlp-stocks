China’s official factory gauge climbed to the highest since July 2014 as a credit-fueled recovery of smokestack industries helped steady the economy.
The manufacturing purchasing managers index rose to 51.7 in November, the National Bureau of Statistics said Thursday, compared with a median estimate of 51 in a Bloomberg survey of economists and 51.2 the prior month. The non-manufacturing PMI was at 54.7 compared with 54 in October. Numbers higher than 50 indicate improving conditions.
The central bank started moving toward selective tightening in recent weeks as it turns the corner away from monetary stimulus amid fresh evidence of broad economic stabilization. That’s allowing policy makers to shift focus to reining in financial risks such as the red-hot big-city property markets, where curbs to cool price gains are gradually starting to bite .

"Underlying data shows that this is pretty clearly heavy-industry driven, with help from credit and little contribution from consumption," said Christopher Balding, an associate professor at the HSBC School of Business at Peking University in Shenzhen. "While this may prop up growth in the short term, it is clearly not rebalancing or deleveraging."
The reading for new orders strengthened to 53.2 from 52.8 the prior month, while new export orders rose to 50.3 from 49.2. Input prices jumped to 68.3 from 62.6.
Expectations for business activity softened, falling to 55.5 from the prior month’s 58.5, the weakest reading since July.
