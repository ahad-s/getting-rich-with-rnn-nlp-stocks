CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: 2017 Outlook: U.S. Not-for-Profit Hospitals and Healthcare Systems (Growing Pressure and Rising Uncertainty)
https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/891119
The sector outlook for U.S. not-for-profit hospitals and healthcare remains negative for 2017 while rating outlook for 2017 is stable. However, the number of downgrades is expected to exceed upgrades in the coming year, according to a Fitch Ratings report.
Fitch expects overall industry profitability to be slightly weaker in 2017 but believes the sector can maintain operating performance near 2016 results. The expected pressure on margins reflects the impact of a continued erosion in payor mix in 2017 as the aging baby boom generation moves into Medicare and as newly eligible Medicaid patients access more healthcare services to address deferred care and chronic conditions. The impact of a shifting payor mix is anticipated to be exacerbated by growing wage and benefit pressures due to the improving U.S. economy and the increasing demand for nurses and mid-level clinical staff in particular.
The election of Trump, combined with Republican majorities in Congress, raises the likelihood that fundamental changes will be made to the ACA. Although details of Republican plans to 'repeal and replace' ACA are limited, an elimination of the ACA's key coverage expansion provisions - resulting in rising uninsured and uncompensated care levels - would be credit negative.
"Over the longer term, the sector will be increasingly challenged by regulatory and political uncertainty, the growth in Medicare and Medicaid payors, and meager rate increases," said Jim Lebuhn, Senior Director and head of the not-for-profit healthcare sector.
"Uncertainty and turmoil have been persistent throughout the ACA's nearly seven-year history, and the industry is in for more of the same in 2017. Despite President-elect Trump's campaign promise to repeal the ACA, Fitch does not expect that key coverage expansions under Medicaid and through the insurance exchanges will be eliminated immediately."

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.

A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report.
