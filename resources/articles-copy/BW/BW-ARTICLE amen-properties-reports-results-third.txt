DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Amen Properties, Inc. (OTC Pink: AMEN) today announced financial results for its fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016. The Company posted quarterly revenue of $203 thousand and net income of $1.1 million, or $21.07 per diluted share. These results compare to revenue of $466 thousand and net income of $265 thousand, or $4.98 per diluted share, for the same quarter last year. The increase in profitability was driven by a large gain recognized on the sale of leasehold interests, offset by reductions in revenue caused by decreases in commodity prices.
Amen also announced that its Company’s Board of Directors has approved the payment of a quarterly dividend of $10 per share, to be paid on December 30, 2016 to shareholders of record as of December 23, 2016.
Finally, Amen reiterated that its Board has approved a plan whereby the Company will no longer hedge the revenue stream associated with its oil and gas royalties. “Shareholders of Amen need to understand that they hold an un-hedged long oil and gas position and should pursue their own hedging strategy if they are uncomfortable with that risk,” said Kris Oliver, Amen’s Chief Executive Officer.
The Company’s 2016 third quarter report is available for viewing or download from the company’s web site – www.amenproperties.com.
