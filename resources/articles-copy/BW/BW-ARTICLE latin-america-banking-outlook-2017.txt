DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Latin America Banking Outlook 2017: A Timid Recovery" report to their offering.
The Banking Outlook for 2017 uses data from the major financial publications, interviews with industry insiders and analysts, information from companies and governments, along with its own in-house content to provide the reader a picture of where the banking industry is headed in Latin America next year. The report includes graphs and tables illustrating the major trends in the industry.
The region has faced a market slowdown in recent years. For 2017, expectations of a return to economic growth in Brazil and Argentina, a mild improvement in countries such as Colombia and Peru and falling inflationary pressures are fueling expectations of a timid recovery in credit growth for banks following a significant slowdown in 2016.
Following a decade of strong economic growth during which Latin American banks rapidly expanded lending to both companies and individuals, the region has faced a market slowdown in recent years. Economic and political crises pushed major markets Brazil and Argentina into recession in 2016, while the fall in global commodities prices has negatively affected raw materials exporters such as Chile, Colombia and Peru, contributing to a reduction in private investment and pressuring government spending.
