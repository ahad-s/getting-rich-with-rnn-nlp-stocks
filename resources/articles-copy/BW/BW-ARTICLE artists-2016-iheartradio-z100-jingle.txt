NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
iHeartMedia has teamed up with the super star artists participating in the 2016 iHeartRadio Z100 Jingle Ball Presented by Capital One on Friday, Dec. 9 at New York City’s Madison Square Garden, and Robin Hood, New York City’s largest poverty fighting organization, to raise money to help the homeless during the holiday season with the release of an original version of the iconic classic holiday song “Santa Claus is Coming To Town.” The special collaboration will be performed live on stage by DNCE along with special guests Daya, Hailee Steinfeld, Fifth Harmony, Tinashe, Charlie Puth, Rita Ora and others. Fans and listeners can contribute to the cause by donating via text or online.
There are more than 1.8 million New Yorkers living in poverty. Over 60,000 of them live in homeless shelters, including 23,000 children – enough to fill Madison Square Garden.
For those wanting to help Robin Hood and iHeartMedia shelter and feed the homeless in NYC, donations may be made by texting 27722 to give $10, or visiting rh.org/give. Thanks to the generosity of all participating musicians, music labels and Robin Hood’s board of directors, 100 percent of the proceeds will benefit local homeless families in New York. Additionally, the Robin Hood Board will match all contributions up to $100K.
This special holiday song release marks the beginning of an annual tradition of the iHeartRadio Jingle Ball Tour Presented Capital One. The exclusive version of ‘Santa Claus is Coming to Town’ will broadcast live on over 100 iHeartRadio stations across the country and video streamed live on CWTV.com tonight. The song will also be included in the CW Network exclusive national broadcast of the 2016 iHeartRadio Jingle Ball Presented by Capital One on December 15. And, beginning Saturday, Dec. 10 the song will be played on hundreds of iHeartMedia’s radio stations across the country through Christmas day.
“The homeless in New York City and across the country are hardest hit during the holiday season and its incredible to see that once again musicians and artists have stepped up to help those less fortunate,” said John Sykes, President of Entertainment Enterprises at iHeartMedia. “iHeartMedia is committed to using all of our powerful assets -- radio, digital, video, live events and social -- in the spirit of giving back to the needy during the holidays.”
