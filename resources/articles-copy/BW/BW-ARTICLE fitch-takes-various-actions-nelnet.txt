NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Fitch Ratings has taken the following rating actions on Nelnet Student Loan Trust 2006-2:
--Class A-5 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
--Class A-6 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
--Class A-7 downgraded to 'BBBsf' from 'AAAsf'; removed from Rating Watch Negative and assigned Outlook Stable;
--Class B downgraded to 'BBsf' from 'Asf'; removed from Rating Watch Negative and assigned Outlook Stable.
Fitch modelled the failed remarketing rate of LIBOR + 0.75% on the class A-6 and class A-7 reset rates notes, which limits excess spread and drives the downgrades above.
KEY RATING DRIVERS
U.S. Sovereign Risk: The trust collateral is comprised of 100% Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) loans, with guaranties provided by eligible guarantors and reinsurance provided by the U.S. Department of Education (ED) for at least 97% of principal and accrued interest. The U.S. sovereign rating is currently 'AAA'/Outlook Stable.
Collateral Performance: Fitch assumes a base case default rate of 16.8% and a 50.3% default rate under the 'AAA' credit stress scenario, which is based on actual trust performance. The claim reject rate is assumed to be 0.25% in the base case and 2% in the 'AAA' case. Fitch applies the standard default timing curve in its credit stress cash flow analysis. The trailing-12-month (TTM) average constant default rate, utilized in the maturity stresses, is 2.6%. TTM levels of deferment, forbearance, income-based repayment (prior to adjustment) and constant prepayment rate (voluntary and involuntary) are 6.6%, 7.5%, 12.6%, and 9.0%, respectively, and are used as the starting point in cash flow modelling. Subsequent declines or increases are modelled as per criteria. The borrower benefit is assumed to be approximately 0.23%, based on information provided by the sponsor.
Basis and Interest Rate Risk: Fitch applies its standard basis and interest rate stresses to this transaction as per criteria.
Payment Structure: Credit enhancement (CE) is provided by overcollateralization (OC), excess spread and, for the class A notes, subordination. As of September 2016, total and senior effective parity ratios are 100.10% (0.10% CE) and 104.64% (4.43% CE). Liquidity support is provided by a reserve equal to its floor of $3,055,686. The transaction is releasing cash.
Maturity Risk: Fitch's SLABS cash flow model indicates that the notes are paid in full on or prior to the legal final maturity dates under the commensurate rating scenario.
Operational Capabilities: Day-to-day servicing is provided by Nelnet Inc. Fitch believes Nelnet Inc. to be an acceptable servicer, due to its extensive track record as a servicer of FFELP loans.
RATING SENSITIVITIES
'AAAsf' rated tranches of most FFELP securitizations will likely move in tandem with the U.S. sovereign rating, given the strong linkage to the U.S. sovereign by nature of the reinsurance and SAP provided by ED. Sovereign risks are not addressed in Fitch's sensitivity analysis.
Fitch conducted a CE sensitivity analysis by stressing both the related lifetime default rate and basis spread assumptions. In addition, Fitch conducted a maturity sensitivity analysis by running different assumptions for the IBR usage and prepayment rate. The results below should only be considered as one potential model implied outcome, as the transaction is exposed to multiple risk factors that are all dynamic variables.
Credit Stress Rating Sensitivity
--Default increase 25%: class A 'BBBsf'; class B 'BBsf'
--Default increase 50%: class A 'BBBsf'; class B 'BBsf'
--Basis Spread increase 0.25%: class A 'BBBsf'; class B 'BBsf'
--Basis Spread increase 0.50%: class A 'BBBsf'; class B 'BBsf'
Maturity Stress Rating Sensitivity
--CPR decrease 50%: class A 'BBBsf'; class B 'BBsf'
--CPR increase 100%: class A 'BBBsf'; class B 'BBsf'
--IBR Usage increase 100%: class A 'BBBsf'; class B 'BBsf'
--IBR Usage decrease 50%: class A 'BBBsf'; class B 'BBsf'
It is important to note that the stresses are intended to provide an indication of the rating sensitivity of the notes to unexpected deterioration in trust performance. Rating sensitivity should not be used as an indicator of future rating performance.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.
The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.
