PORTLAND, Ore.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Gaining lease ownership over connectivity to the fiber-optic cables terminating at its Hillsboro Data Centers, ViaWest announced a new agreement with CoastCom, a fiber based service provider on the Oregon Coast and a division of Wave Broadband. The most recent addition to the Hillsboro Data Center Ring, ViaWest now shares network access pathways with other Hillsboro-area data centers through the agreement.
“CoastCom is the linchpin that is quickly establishing Hillsboro as the Northwest hub for fiber-optic connections in the region and to Asia-Pacific,” said Tim Parker, Vice President of Network Services for ViaWest. “Our agreement with CoastCom positions ViaWest as a premier player as Hillsboro continues to become a primary North American carrier nerve center. It also establishes us as a key investor in the Hillsboro Data Center Ring for metro cross-connect opportunities between ViaWest and other local data centers.”
CoastCom operates a submarine cable landing station in Pacific City, and it owns and operates redundant path diverse terrestrial fiber backhaul routes from there to Hillsboro. CoastCom has constructed an ultra high-count, low-loss fiber ring connecting six data centers in the Hillsboro area to this fiber network. ViaWest owns two of the six data centers on the fiber ring, which connects all six facilities to several existing and planned transpacific submarine cables.
“Through this agreement, ViaWest has the right to resell connectivity to clients seeking access to services or carriers in other Portland-area data centers,” said Greg Palser, Vice President for Business Development for CoastCom. “We’re excited that ViaWest has supported our high density fiber ring in such a big way. With their connectivity options, ViaWest’s Hillsboro Data Centers are now the premier data centers in the region.”
Through carrier cross-connections, ViaWest and other members of the Hillsboro Data Center Ring can offer exponentially more service provider choices to clients and capture additional revenue from clients of other data centers in the Ring through managed bandwidth arrangements. The network access is secure, reliable and convenient for clients.
“We are excited about the additional options that participation in the Hillsboro Data Center Ring brings ViaWest clients, such as direct access to hyperscale public cloud solutions such as Amazon Web Services,” said Bill Cory, regional vice president at ViaWest. “Likewise, we look forward to serving clients of nearby data centers by connecting them to our new cloud node for improved computing capabilities.”
ViaWest’s Hillsboro Data Centers offer more than 50,000 square feet of raised floor capacity, providing colocation and hosting services for a range of clients on the West Coast. ViaWest recently established a cloud node in its Brookwood Data Center, also located in Hillsboro.
