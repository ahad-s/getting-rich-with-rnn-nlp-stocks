NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Fitch Ratings has downgraded Higher Education Loan Authority of the State of Missouri Series 2012-1 notes to 'Asf' from 'AAAsf'; removed from Rating Watch Negative and assigned Outlook Stable.
The notes pay in full before their maturity in scenarios up to the 'BBBsf' maturity stresses. Because their maturity date of January 2026 is greater than seven years away, and the notes are currently rated 'AAAsf', they are eligible for the downgrade tolerance of one rating category. This results in the downgrade to 'Asf'.
KEY RATING DRIVERS
U.S. Sovereign Risk: The trust collateral consists of 100% of Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) loans, including 8.7% rehabilitation loans. Guarantees are provided by the transaction's eligible guarantors and reinsurance is provided by the U.S. Department of Education (ED) for at least 97% of principal and accrued interest. The U.S. sovereign rating is currently 'AAA', Outlook Stable by Fitch.
Collateral Performance: For MOHELA 2012-1, Fitch assumes a 14% base case default rate and a 42.00% default rate under the 'AAA' credit stress scenario. The claim reject rate is assumed to be 0.50% in the base case and 3% in the 'AAA' case. Fitch applies the standard default timing curve in its credit stress cash flow analysis. The trailing 12-month (TTM) constant default rate, utilized in the maturity stress is 3.8%. The TTM average levels of deferment, forbearance, income-based repayment (before adjustment) and constant prepayment rate (voluntary and involuntary) are 10.0%, 7.2%, 10.6%, and 13.2%, respectively, which are used as the starting point in cash flow modelling. Subsequent declines or increases are modelled as per criteria. The borrower benefit is assumed to be approximately 0.11% based on information provided by the sponsor.
Basis and Interest Rate Risk: Fitch applies its standard basis and interest rate stresses to this transaction as per criteria.
Payment Structure: Credit Enhancement (CE) is provided by overcollateralization and excess spread. As of the November 2016 distribution report, total parity is 107.87%. Liquidity support is provided by a reserve account currently sized at the greater of 0.25% of the pool balance, and 0.15% of the initial pool balance. As of November 2016, the debt service reserve fund balance is $383,468. The transaction is in turbo and no cash is being released from the trust.
Maturity Risk: The class A notes pay in full before their maturity in scenarios up to the 'BBBsf' maturity stresses. This transaction is sensitive to expense assumptions. Fitch modelled this deal assuming the transaction will continue to turbo payment with no payment of carryover servicing fee. If carryover servicing fee would be paid, the transaction might not be able to pass cash flows at investment grade.
Operational Capabilities: Day-to-day servicing will be provided by MOHELA. Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency (PHEAA) acts as backup servicer for the entire pool. MOHELA and PHEAA have demonstrated adequate servicing capabilities for FFELP student loans. Fitch believes all to be acceptable servicers of FFELP student loans at this time.
RATING SENSITIVITIES
'AAAsf' rated tranches of most FFELP securitizations will likely move in tandem with the U.S. sovereign rating, given the strong linkage to the U.S. sovereign by nature of the reinsurance and SAP provided by ED. Sovereign risks are not addressed in Fitch's sensitivity analysis.
Fitch conducted a CE sensitivity analysis by stressing both the related lifetime default rate and basis spread assumptions. In addition, Fitch conducted a maturity sensitivity analysis by running different assumptions for the IBR usage and prepayment rate. The results below should only be considered as one potential model implied outcome as the transaction is exposed to multiple risk factors that are all dynamic variables.
Credit Stress Rating Sensitivity
--Default increase 25%: class A 'AAAsf';
--Default increase 50%: class A 'AAAsf';
--Basis Spread increase 0.25%: class A 'AAAsf';
--Basis Spread increase 0.50%: class A 'AAAsf'.
Maturity Stress Rating Sensitivity
--CPR decrease 50%: class A 'CCCsf';
--CPR increase 100%: class A 'AAAsf';
--IBR Usage increase 100%: class A 'Bsf';
--IBR Usage decrease 50%: class A 'Asf'.
It is important to note that the stresses are intended to provide an indication of the rating sensitivity of the notes to unexpected deterioration in trust performance. Rating sensitivity should not be used as an indicator of future rating performance.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.

A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent).
