SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Manhattan Street Capital, Inc. (www.manhattanstreetcapital.com), a first-mover platform for growth stage companies seeking sizable equity capital under the SEC’s Regulation A+, has just launched its first live offering: Blue Marble Biomaterials, of Missoula, Mont. Blue Marble is the first biomaterials company to file an intent to offer equity shares to the public via Regulation A+.
Since the inception of Regulation A+ in 2015, Manhattan Street Capital has been a frontrunner in the effort to educate growth stage companies about the advantages Regulation A+ embodies, such as post investment liquidity, that investors at any wealth level worldwide can participate, brand building and providing more control for founders over their funding path, along with new funding alternatives that are streamlined and less expensive than traditional IPOs and provide more flexibility – well suited to mid-sized companies.
Manhattan Street’s founder and CEO Rod Turner is an expert on Regulation A+ and other funding alternatives, and has advised some 300 companies on their fitness for Regulation A+ offerings thus far. The company is working with a roster of companies in the process of preparing for upcoming offerings, and working with Manhattan Street’s selected marketing agencies and other service providers such as Broker-Dealers and underwriters.
“Manhattan Street Capital has been instrumental in the launch of our Regulation A+ online public offering,” said Colby Underwood, co-CEO of Blue Marble Biomaterials.
Turner provides monthly Reg A+ Updates from the ManhattanStreetCapital.com blog, is a frequent columnist and presenter, and is also an ongoing columnist for Forbes.com.
"We begin our process by helping companies assess if Regulation A+ is a good fit for their business and their capital raising plans,” Turner said. “We introduce them to the service providers they need for successful Regulation A+ offerings, and we list their offerings and integrate them with the necessary back-end systems on our website, while levering the proprietary technology built into our platform.”
Manhattan Street advises companies through the fundraising process to increase the success and efficiency of the offerings on its platform.
“We specialize in Reg A+,” Turner continued. “We focus on the more established businesses for which Regulation A+ is uniquely well suited.”
