According to the lawsuit, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) ARC-520, one of Arrowhead’s drug candidates for patients with chronic hepatitis B infection, was fatal at certain doses; (2) consequently, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration was unlikely to approve ARC-520 as a hepatitis B treatment; (3) Arrowhead had overstated the approval prospects and commercial viability of ARC-520; and (4) as a result, Arrowhead’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.
