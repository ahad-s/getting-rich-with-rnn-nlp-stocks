The acquisition strengthens and expands O+B’s digital capabilities, which has been a top agency priority in recent years. Likewise, the addition of a Nashville office opens up a lucrative market for business and creative talent, which will help accelerate the agency’s growth strategy.
Additionally, Paramore’s clients – many of which are in tourism and education spaces such as the Nashville Chamber of Commerce, Vanderbilt University and Visit Central Florida – will benefit from the acquisition as the O+B team brings an array of service offerings, including broadcast production, advertising, PR and internal communications, to the agency.
Rhonda Ries, president at O+B, said the deal represents growth and expansion for both firms.
“Our success together is proven. O+B and Paramore partnered together on a variety of projects for several months and we saw that the Paramore team shares our philosophy in running their agency with a ‘client-first’ approach,” Ries said. “With both companies already profitable on their own, we expect to see a new level of success both in terms of profit and benefits to our employees and clients.”
O+B’s Missouri-based offices have a combined staff of 120 employees. With the acquisition of Paramore, the comprised holding company will have 145 employees in three key markets. O+B currently serves clients around the country such as United Soybean Board, Merck Animal Health, Michelin, Morton Buildings, Monsanto and Verdesian Life Sciences, and will continue growing the agency’s client roster following this acquisition.
