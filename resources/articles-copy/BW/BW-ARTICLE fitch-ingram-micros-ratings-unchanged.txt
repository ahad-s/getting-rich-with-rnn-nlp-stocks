CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Ingram Micro Inc.'s (Ingram Micro) 'BBB-' Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured debt ratings are not affected by the close of the company's previously announced merger with Tianjin Tianhai Investment Co., Ltd. (Tianjin Tianhai), according to Fitch Ratings. Ingram Micro had approximately $1.3 billion of debt outstanding as of Oct. 1, 2016.
The ratings reflect Fitch's view of Ingram Micro as a standalone entity due to the weak legal and operational ties with Tianjin Tianhai and the ultimate parent HNA Group. Ingram Micro is not responsible for liabilities of Tianjin Tianhai, including its $4.3 billion loan from the Agricultural Bank of China, New York Branch, whose proceeds will be used to fund the transaction. Conversely the debt outstanding at Ingram Micro does not benefit from any guaranty from either Tianjin Tianhai or HNA Group. Ingram Micro has amended its senior unsecured revolving credit facility credit agreement and senior unsecured note indentures, limiting the company's ability to upstream dividends to its shareholders. Ingram Micro will operate as a separate entity with a separate management team, board of directors and treasury functions.
Fitch does not expect any material change to existing financial policies and expects credit protection measures to remain solid for the rating through the intermediate term. Total debt adjusted for rental expense to operating EBITDAR (adjusted leverage) should remain below 3.5x over the intermediate term and was 2.5x for the latest 12 months (LTM) ended Oct. 1, 2016. Operating EBITDA to gross interest expense should remain near 10x or better over the intermediate term and was 10.3x for this LTM period.
Liquidity was solid as of Oct. 1, 2016 and consisted primarily of $689 million in cash and cash equivalents ($301 million in the U.S.), an undrawn $1.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility expiring January 2020 and approximately $854 million of available capacity under the company's trade accounts receivable-backed financing programs. Upon consummation of the merger, Ingram Micro's revolving credit facility commitment was reduced from $1.5 billion to 1.05 billion.
RATING SENSITIVITIES
Negative: Fitch's expectations for adjusted leverage sustained above 3.5x, driven by: (i) lower operating EBITDA from sustained revenue declines or competitive pricing; or (ii) negative free cash flow (FCF) from lower profitability in conjunction with diminished working capital efficiency.
Positive: Fitch does not anticipate positive rating action, given Ingram Micro's low profitability and significant working capital needs; however, positive rating actions could result from: (i) expectations for higher FCF of $750 million to $1 billion from sustained revenue growth and modest profit margin expansion; and (ii) management's commitment to managing borrowings to maintain adjusted leverage below 2x.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.
The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.
