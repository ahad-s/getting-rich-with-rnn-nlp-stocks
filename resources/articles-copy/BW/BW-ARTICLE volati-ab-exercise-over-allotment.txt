STOCKHOLM--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Regulatory News:
Exercise of over-allotment option in Volati (VOLO.ST)
Carnegie and Nordea (together “Joint Global Coordinators”) have today notified Volati AB (publ) (“Volati” or the “Company”) that the over-allotment option has been exercised in full in respect of 1,896,551 new common shares in Volati.
In connection with the initial public offering of Volati (the “IPO”), the Company granted Nordea, as stabilisation agent for Joint Global Coordinators, an over-allotment option to subscribe for additional 1,896,551 new common shares in the Company, corresponding to up to 10 percent of the total number of common shares comprised in the offering, to be used to cover over-allotment of shares. The Joint Global Coordinators have today exercised the over-allotment option in full and Volati have received issue proceeds of SEK 1,210 million before issue costs. No stabilisation has been carried out since the IPO, and as a result of Volati’s common share price development, the Joint Global Coordinators have decided to end the stabilisation period.
Following exercise of the over-allotment option the total number of common shares in Volati amount to 80,406,571 shares. The offering in connection to the IPO including the over-allotment option have thus comprised 20,862,069 common shares, which corresponds to a dilution of 25.4 percent of the previous number of common shares and 25.9 percent of the previous number of votes in Volati.
Volati’s largest common shareholders after exercise of the over-allotment option are Karl Perlhagen (42.8 percent of the total number of common shares in Volati), Patrik Wahlén (23.7 percent), Didner & Gerge Funds (5.4 percent), The Fourth Swedish National Pension Fund (4.3 percent) and Handelsbanken Funds (3.2 percent).
