CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
George P. Johnson Experience Marketing, the world’s leading experiential marketing agency, has partnered with BravoSolution, a leading global strategic procurement solution provider, to automate and enhance sourcing processes. George P. Johnson (GPJ) deploys the BravoAdvantage Sourcing and Supply Value Management (SVM) platforms and works closely with BravoSolution’s services team to ensure smooth implementation and adoption and successfully onboard and qualify suppliers.
“Our ultimate goal in finding a procurement provider was to uncover new savings throughout our business that we could share with our partners,” said John Staniszewski, senior procurement manager at George P. Johnson Experience Marketing. “To us, a successful relationship required both a strong global presence and sophisticated yet easy-to-use enterprise-wide technology that would streamline processes across our entire business and give us the ability to conduct side-by-side comparison reports to drive additional cost savings.”
GPJ is using BravoAdvantage to create a centralized database for self-registration and supplier documentation, including master service and non-disclosure agreements, insurance documentation and minority certifications. Through offering best practices and sourcing workflows, BravoSolution has been able to help facilitate strong post-implementation user adoption, leading to 60 RFPs and 270 onboarded third-party suppliers through the system to date. This has contributed to a total of $1.6 million in savings for the organization.
“Procurement excellence starts with getting everyone on the same page, both from a process and adoption standpoint,” said Jim Wetekamp, chief executive officer at BravoSolution. “When teams have the tools they need to streamline processes and make their lives simpler, the adoption process is much quicker and the organization’s ability to provide impactful value for both their business and clients is much greater.”
