NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Fitch Ratings has affirmed J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust commercial mortgage pass-through certificates series 2007-LDP12. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this ratings action commentary.
KEY RATING DRIVERS
The affirmations and Stable Rating Outlooks reflect sufficient credit enhancement relative to pool expected losses. As of the November 2016 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 49% to $1.28 billion from $2.5 billion at issuance. Per the servicer reporting, 16 loans (10% of the pool) are defeased. Interest shortfalls are currently affecting classes D through NR.
Higher Loss Expectations: Fitch modeled losses of 18.4% of the remaining pool; expected losses on the original pool balance total 15.4%, including $151.4 million (6% of the original pool balance) in realized losses to date. Modeled losses at the previous rating action were 12.7% of the original pool balance. The higher modeled loss is due to higher losses on the specially serviced loans, including additional specially serviced loans. The three largest contributors to expected losses are Liberty Plaza (3.1% of the pool), a real estate owned (REO) asset, BB&T Tower (2.2%), REO asset and St. Joe-150 Main St., an office building in Norfolk, VA (3.5%) with lease volatility.
Increased Defeasance: Sixteen loans (10% of pool) are defeased, up from three loans (2%) at Fitch's last rating action.
Loans of Concern: Fitch has designated 27 (27.4% of current pool balance) Fitch Loans of Concern, which includes 14 specially serviced assets (12.1%). Three of the top 15 loans (7.5%) are currently in special servicing. The specially serviced assets include seven that are REO (8.3%), four loans (0.7%) which are over 90+ days delinquent and three loans (3.1%) in foreclosure.
Maturity Concentration: Excluding the specially serviced assets, 88% of the pool is scheduled to mature in 2017. The majority of the 2017 loan maturities are concentrated during third and fourth quarters (48.5% and 25.6% of pool, respectively).
RATING SENSITIVITIES
The Stable Outlooks on classes A-4, A-1A, and A-M reflect sufficient credit enhancement relative to pool expected losses. The distressed classes may be subject to further downgrades if there is an increase in the number of specially serviced loans and additional losses are realized.

Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.
The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.
For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale clients only.
