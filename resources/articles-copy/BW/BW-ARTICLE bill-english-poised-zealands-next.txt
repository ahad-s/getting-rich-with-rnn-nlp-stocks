Bill English looks set to become New Zealand’s next prime minister after one of his rivals for the leadership pulled out of the race and said it was clear English has the support to win.
“It is clear to me that 50 percent of caucus support Bill English as the leader, and therefore as far as I’m concerned he has won,” Police Minister Judith Collins said Thursday. She urged her supporters to back English when the ruling National Party’s 59 members of parliament vote on the leadership on Dec. 12.
Health Minister Jonathan Coleman remains in the running, though he agreed there is “huge support behind Bill.”
Outgoing prime minister John Key shocked the nation by resigning on Monday, less than a year out from a general election. English, the finance minister and Key’s preferred successor, will have a strong economic platform to take into the 2017 election campaign.

Earlier Thursday, English unveiled a half-year budget update that forecast rising surpluses and a stronger economy than previously expected.
“The good thing is we have choices, and we’ve got some flexibility,” English told reporters. “We’ve got choices about how to use those surpluses and we’ve signaled that tax cuts are one of those options.”
Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce will replace him as finance minister if he becomes prime minister, English said.
English, 54, is a less charismatic politician than Key but seen as a safe pair of hands. He is the architect of much of the economic reform that Key’s government has overseen since being elected in 2008. A father of six and a former farmer, he entered parliament in 1990 and has been Key’s deputy since 2006.
