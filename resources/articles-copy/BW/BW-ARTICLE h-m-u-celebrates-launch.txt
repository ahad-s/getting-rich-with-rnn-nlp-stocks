H&M is honored to have partnered with Alex Katz, one of the most iconic American artists of our time, for the brand’s Fashion Loves Art collaboration featuring a full collection for ladies, men’s and home décor. In 2014, H&M launched the Fashion Loves Art collaboration with artist Jeff Koons for a limited edition Balloon Dog leather handbag. These special collaborations honor the vision of world renowned artists and aspire to democratize art through fashion to make it easily attainable for all.
“The collection is really inspiring. It’s filled with a lot of beautiful art, but I think it’s also nice that you have the ability to wear it,” said Karolina Kurkova.
In an effort to create a meaningful dialogue between fashion and art aficionados alike, H&M chose to launch the collaboration during the leading international contemporary and modern art fair in Miami. Each December, museum professionals and art enthusiasts from around the world gather as a commitment to present and honor cutting-edge and emerging talent.
"The partnership with H&M surpassed my expectations. It is exciting for me to work with H&M to make my art more accessible to more people,” said Alex Katz.
The full collection for ladies and men’s including accessories and home décor features some of Alex Katz’s most iconic works in vibrant pops of color. Starting December 1st, 2016, the collection will be available exclusively in the U.S. at select Miami Stores in Aventura and Lincoln Road as well as online at hm.com. As part of H&M’s efforts for a sustainable fashion future, the majority of the collection is made from sustainable materials like Tencel® and organic cotton.
