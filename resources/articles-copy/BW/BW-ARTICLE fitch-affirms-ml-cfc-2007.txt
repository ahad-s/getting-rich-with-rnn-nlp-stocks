NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Fitch Ratings has affirmed 21 classes of ML-CFC Commercial Mortgage Trust, commercial mortgage pass-through certificates series 2007-8 (ML-CFC 2007-8). A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this release.
Fitch has issued a focus report on this transaction. The report provides a detailed and up-to-date perspective on key credit characteristics of the ML-CFC 2007-8 transaction and property-level performance of the related trust loans.
KEY RATING DRIVERS
Relatively Stable Performance: The affirmations reflect the relatively stable performance of the pool since Fitch's last rating action and modeled losses remain in line with previous expectations. Fitch modeled losses of 20.3% of the remaining pool; expected losses on the original pool balance total 18.5%, including $117 million (4.8% of original pool balance) in realized losses incurred to date. Modeled losses at the last rating action were 18.1% of the original pool balance. As of the November 2016 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 32.2% to $1.65 billion from $2.44 billion at issuance. Cumulative interest shortfalls totaling $59.8 million are affecting classes AJ and AJ-A through T.
Defeasance: According to servicer reporting and as of November 2016, 10.8% of the pool has been defeased, which includes 22 fully defeased loans (10.7%) and one partially defeased loan (defeased portion accounts for 0.1% of pool).
Loans of Concern: Fitch has designated 49 loans (45.6%) as Fitch Loans of Concern, which includes 13 specially serviced loans/assets (29.4%).
Prolonged REO Workouts: Of the seven REO assets comprising 7.2% of the pool, two (3.1%) have been REO since 2012, two (2.4%) since 2013, two since 2014 (0.3%) and one since 2015 (1.4%). Three of the assets in the top 15 are REO, including the two largest, Towers at University Town Center (2.9%) and Douglas Corporate Center I & II (2.2%), which have been REO since 2012 and 2013, respectively.
Loan Concentration: The largest loan, Spring Gate - A/B Notes, comprises 18.3% of the pool, and remains the largest contributor to Fitch modeled loss expectations. The loan remains in special servicing and was previously modified into A/B notes in 2015.
Maturity Concentration: Loan maturities are concentrated in 2017 (91% of pool, excluding REO assets).
Undercollateralization: The pool is undercollateralized as the aggregate balance of the certificates is $217,986 greater than the aggregate collateral balance, as of the November 2016 remittance report. This disparity of principal balances is due to the servicer recovering workout-delayed reimbursement amounts from the transaction's principal collections.
RATING SENSITIVITIES
The Negative Outlook on classes A-3, A-1A, AM and AM-A reflects the uncertainty surrounding the workout and ultimate disposition of the specially serviced loans/assets and the possibility of negative rating migration should performing loans, many of which are highly leveraged, not refinance at maturity as expected. The distressed classes may be subject to further downgrades as additional losses are realized.

Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.
The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.
