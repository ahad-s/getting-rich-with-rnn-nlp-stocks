DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Business Opportunities Related to the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar" report to their offering.
The FIFA World Cup in Qatar has sparked a profusion of new projects. Not only must new sporting facilities be created to enable the large number of simultaneous matches to be held, but all manner of existing Qatari infrastructure must be upgraded in anticipation of the massive crowds that will come to view the games, eat, drink and sleep in the country and visit local tourist attractions between games. Thus, while many projects are new, other already-planned upgrades have been accelerated and scaled up.
