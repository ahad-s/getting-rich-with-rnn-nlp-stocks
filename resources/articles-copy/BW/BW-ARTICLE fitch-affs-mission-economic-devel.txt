CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings on Mission Economic Development Corporation's (Dallas Clean Energy McCommas Bluff LLC, or DCEMB) $40.2 million aggregate series 2011 revenue bonds due 2024 at 'BBB-'.
The Outlook has been revised to Stable from Negative based on the trend of improving financial performance and the potential for higher landfill gas (LFG) production following completion of a new landfill cell. Fitch expects the city of Dallas (the city) to gradually transition landfilling activity toward the new cell; current landfill operations have restricted LFG availability and increased DCEMB's operating costs. DCEMB's rating reflects the price certainty provided by a long-term offtake agreement with an investment-grade counterparty and operating margins that should provide substantial cash flow cushion under normal operating conditions. Fitch believes that DCEMB's financial profile is positioned to improve beyond rating case levels, which currently exhibit average debt service coverage ratios (DSCRs) of 1.79x.
KEY RATING DRIVERS
Revenue Risk: Midrange
Fixed-Price, Long-Term Agreement: The project benefits from a long-term, fixed-price gas sales agreement with Shell Energy North America (Shell) that provides price stability through the life of the contract. In addition to these contracted revenues, the project is expected to earn incremental revenues under base case conditions by selling excess LFG production at market prices. The project does not earn merchant revenues under Fitch's rating case.
Operating Risk: Midrange
Unproven Operating Cost Profile: The project has yet to establish a history of stable operating costs. Since inception, operating costs have exceeded original projections due primarily to ongoing maintenance and repair efforts. The sponsor expects a normalization of costs once landfill operations stabilize.
Supply Risk: Weaker
Heightened Resource Risk: The project is highly dependent on the accuracy of the LFG recovery forecast and the level of interference from landfilling operations, which are currently restricting the project's output. LFG recovery estimates have been revised several times since the original projections due to drought, landfilling timing lags, and fluctuating refuse placement within the project site. Resource risk is partially mitigated by the active nature of a landfill site that is permitted to remain open well beyond the tenor of the project debt.
Debt Structure: Stronger
Enhanced Liquidity, Standard Protections: DCEMB's indebtedness consists of fixed-rate bonds that are scheduled to fully amortize within the relatively short remaining tenor. The project also benefits from a 12-month debt service reserve based on maximum annual debt service, a $1.3 million operating reserve, and typical cash lock-up provisions.
Uncertain Financial Profile: Current financial performance aligns with Fitch's rating case due to poor resource availability but has demonstrated a trend of improvement. Fitch's rating case DSCRs average 1.79x with a minimum of 1.70x under conditions that include reduced availability, lower output, and higher O&M expenses versus base case DSCRs.
PEER GROUP
DCEMB's credit quality is consistent with that of a similarly-rated open-landfill LFG project with rating case DSCRs above 1.7x. Another investment-grade LFG project includes DSCRs below 1.5x but benefits from sponsor guarantees. DCEMB's base case financial metrics are relatively high compared to non-LFG investment grade thermal projects, but Fitch views the additional cushion as appropriate given the heightened level of long-term resource risk.
RATING SENSITIVITIES
Negative: Failure to maintain rating case production levels and/or protracted interference from landfill operations beyond 2017 could result in negative rating action.
Negative: The project's failure to demonstrate a stable cost profile and margins consistent with rating case expectations could reduce credit quality.
Positive: An improvement in credit quality is unlikely absent a demonstrated ability to consistently achieve base case production levels and a stable cost profile.
CREDIT UPDATE
Revenues have improved due to increased LFG production despite ongoing interference from the city's landfill operations. DCEMB expects to achieve a DSCR of 1.87x for YE 2016, or 1.75x if capital expenditures are subtracted from operating cash flow. Financial performance in 2016 was consistent with Fitch's rating case DSCR of 1.88x, and exceeded the 2015 DSCR of 1.49x. It remains uncertain whether DCEMB's recent financial performance represents a sustainable trend, as DCEMB has yet to achieve base case DSCRs that exceed 2.2x.
The restrictions on DCEMB's operations were partially relieved in early 2016, allowing daily LFG production to temporarily exceed 6,600 MMBtu. Daily LFG production has since moderated to the 5,500 to 5,900 MMBtu range, which represents a 10% increase over average production in 2015. The project's operating costs remain elevated above base case levels, though DCEMB expects that costs should moderate once the project replaces aging filters in the sulfur removal system and installs new gas compressors in 2017. DCEMB continues to budget for the drilling of new wells as existing wells become unproductive or are blocked off by landfill operations.
The city completed the expansion of the McCommas Bluff landfill and began operation of the new cell in July, and DCEMB anticipates that the city will fully transition landfill operations to the new cell before the second half of 2017. Landfill operations will continue to hamper LFG production in the interim, albeit with diminished intensity, although financial performance at current levels supports the current rating. Longer term, Fitch believes that the landfill expansion should alleviate DCEMB's current operational constraints and allow for additional LFG production.
Fitch believes it reasonable that DCEMB's financial performance in 2017 will exceed the YE 2016 estimate based on the prospective relief from landfill operations. However, Fitch views DCEMB's budgeted DSCR of 4.31x for 2017 as highly dependent upon a number of favorable developments. Fitch's rating case DSCRs average 1.79x with a minimum of 1.70x under conditions that include a 5% reduction to availability, a 2% increase to treating loss, a 15% reduction to resource availability, and a 15% increase to O&M expenses. Fitch's rating case does not include revenues other than those derived from the contract with Shell.
