The euro reached a three-week high as investors awaited the European Central Bank’s monetary policy decision, with traders expecting that officials will extend the asset-purchase program for at least another six months at the current pace, though with a risk of a slower rate of purchases.
Europe’s shared currency strengthened versus most of its 16 major peers, while Italian government bonds led declines across the region. That’s even as most economists in a Bloomberg survey forecast that ECB President Mario Draghi will announce an extension of the central bank’s quantitative easing at 80 billion euros ($86 billion) a month. However, some analysts say that any extension to QE may be the last before the ECB starts to taper its bond-buying.

“There really is a disconnect between pricing and what economists expect,” said Jordan Rochester, a foreign-exchange strategist at Nomura Holdings Plc in London. “All but one or two on the street are calling for a taper. Still, the euro price action going into this meeting and the consensus of economists simply does not agree. We expect once this risk event is out of the way the dollar will continue to outperform and the euro will approach 1.05 yet again.”
