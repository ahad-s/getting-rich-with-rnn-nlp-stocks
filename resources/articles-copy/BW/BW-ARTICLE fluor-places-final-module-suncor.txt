As part of its engineering, procurement, fabrication and construction scope, Fluor managed module fabrication and shipment of the modules, all of which were fabricated by Fluor’s Supreme Modular Fabrication Inc. (SMFI) joint venture fabrication yard near Edmonton, Alberta. Engineering and construction personnel were integrated into the fabrication teams to support construction-driven execution through the phases and the 95 modules were fabricated and shipped in 10 months, aligning to the site setting schedule and on budget.
“This milestone was achieved on schedule and on budget using Fluor’s integrated engineering, procurement, fabrication and construction approach to clients’ projects,” said Mark Fields, president of Fluor’s Energy & Chemicals business in the Americas region. “Fluor worked in collaboration with Suncor – the groups were closely aligned on fabrication priorities and module placement dates.”
The East Tank Farm Development, which will be a Suncor-operated midstream asset, is currently under construction in the Wood Buffalo Region of Alberta. The facility will consist of bitumen storage, blending and cooling facilities and connectivity to third-party pipelines.
