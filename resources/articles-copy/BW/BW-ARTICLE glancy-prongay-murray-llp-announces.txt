LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP (“GPM”) announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed on behalf of investors who purchased Dynavax Technologies Corporation (“Dynavax” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: DVAX) securities between March 10, 2014 and November 11, 2016, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Dynavax investors have until January 17, 2017 to file a lead plaintiff motion.
Investors suffering losses on their Dynavax investments are encouraged to contact Lesley Portnoy of GPM to discuss their legal rights in this class action at 310-201-9150 or by email to shareholders@glancylaw.com.
According to the Complaint filed in this lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) there were significant adverse events associated with Dynavax’s HEPLISAV-B product, including an imbalance in the number of cardiac events during use; (2) consequently, a commercial product launch of HEPLISAV-B was less imminent than Dynavax had led investors to believe; and (3) as a result, Dynavax’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.
If you purchased shares of Dynavax during the Class Period you may move the Court no later than January 17, 2017 to ask the Court to appoint you as lead plaintiff. To be a member of the Class you need not take any action at this time; you may retain counsel of your choice or take no action and remain an absent member of the Class.
