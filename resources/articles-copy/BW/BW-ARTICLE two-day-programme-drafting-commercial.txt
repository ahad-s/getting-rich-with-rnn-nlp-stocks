DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Drafting Commercial Contracts for the Pharmaceutical Industry" conference to their offering.
In such a highly regulated industry, understanding the key challenges of negotiation and drafting an effective and watertight contract on an international level is a complex topic. They can be difficult for even the most well equipped in-house lawyer and most often it is not the lawyer in the driving seat. Commercial managers from all areas of the pharmaceutical industry are leading negotiations and drafting and managing key contracts on a daily basis. It is vital that both legal counsel and commercial executives not only have the key skills and tactics to create a win:win scenario but also the knowledge to ensure any agreement is within the laws and regulations. The alternative is the exposure of the organisation to unnecessary risk and costly disputes.
This unique three-day programme that looks at both elements of the process has been developed. Using practical exercises, industry examples, and discussions to examine the key skills needed from both legal and commercial viewpoints and how they integrate.
The programme consists of five modules which:
1. Will deliver an in-depth examination of intellectual property issues that affect pharmaceutical industry agreements
2. Will focus on competition regulations pertinent to pharmaceutical industry agreements
3. Will analyse the commercial and legal issues affecting pharmaceutical industry agreements
4. Will examine collaboration and licensing agreements
5. Features an in-depth workshop on effective negotiation skills
