NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Fitch Ratings has upgraded the following Wilson, NC ratings:
--Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'AA+' from 'AA';
--$7.3 million general obligation (GO) bonds, series 2009 to 'AA+' from 'AA'.
The Rating Outlook is Stable.
SECURITY
The bonds are general obligations of the city for the payment of which the city's full faith and credit and unlimited taxing power are irrevocably pledged.
KEY RATING DRIVERS
The upgrade reflects application of Fitch's revised criteria for U.S. state and local governments, which was released on April 18. The revised criteria highlight the city's solid revenue framework, low long-term liability burden, and outstanding gap-closing capacity. The 'AA+' IDR and GO ratings reflect the city's stable growth prospects and ample financial flexibility, including sizable reserves and broad budgetary tools.
Economic Resource Base
Wilson is located along Interstate 95 roughly 50 miles east of Raleigh. The city's estimated 2015 population of 49,643 has experienced modest growth of about 1% since 2010.
Revenue Framework: 'aa' factor assessment
Revenues have been rising at a pace in line with U.S. GDP growth. The city has the independent legal ability to raise property tax revenues in an unlimited amount.
Expenditure Framework: 'aa' factor assessment
Expenditures have grown at about the pace of revenues, and Fitch expects that trend to continue. Low carrying costs and broad flexibility to manage labor-related costs allow the city solid leeway to adjust spending throughout economic cycles.
Long-Term Liability Burden: 'aaa' factor assessment
The combined burden of debt and unfunded pension liabilities is low in relation to personal income and should remain relatively stable over time based on modest future capital and issuance plans, rapid principal amortization (100% in five years) and minimal pension liabilities.
Operating Performance: 'aaa' factor assessment
The city's superior budget flexibility including ample general fund balance positions it to comfortably manage through economic downturns without diminishing its overall financial flexibility.
RATING SENSITIVITIES
Continued Strong Financial Operations: The rating is sensitive to shifts in fundamental credit characteristics, including the city's strong financial flexibility. The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that such shifts are unlikely.
CREDIT PROFILE
Manufacturing makes up a significant portion of local economic activity. There is a diverse mix of industries within the sector, including pharmaceutical, tire, and tobacco-related companies. Bridgestone Americas, Inc., one of the city's top employers, is in the process of expanding its facilities. The city's tax base is somewhat concentrated with the top taxpayer accounting for nearly 4% of assessed value (AV) and the top ten taxpayers 17%. City officials expect that recent improvements to local industrial parks should attract new investment.
Employment growth has lagged both the U.S. and the state which is reflected in the city's high unemployment rate.
Revenue Framework
The city relies on a combination of property taxes and sales and other taxes, which equate to 49% and 16% of general fund revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2016, as well as intergovernmental revenues (17%).
The city's general fund revenue growth has trended above the rate of inflation on a compound average annual (CAGR) basis over the 10 years ended in fiscal 2016 at over 3%. While the city's AV CAGR for the same period was in line with total revenue growth, AV declined in fiscal 2017. Sales tax revenues have performed well over the past decade but revenue growth does include some broadening of the sales tax base.
The city maintains a healthy capacity under the statutory property tax cap of $1.50 per $100 of AV with a fiscal 2017 tax rate of $0.555.
Expenditure Framework
The city's largest spending area is public safety, which makes up about 48% of general fund spending.
The pace of spending on operating functions is likely to remain in line with revenue growth. As such, spending growth is expected to increase in line with revenue growth.
The city's expenditure flexibility is aided by a workforce environment that is favorable to management. Employment terms are not subject to collective bargaining. As such, management has independent control of compensation and work rules. The city makes annual contributions for capital projects which in fiscal 2016 totaled over $2 million or a notable 5% of general fund spending, adding additional budgetary flexibility.
Carrying costs associated with debt service, actuarially determined pension payments and OPEB actual contributions totaled a low 8% of governmental spending in fiscal 2016. Carrying costs include contributions to the state's Local Governmental Employees' Retirement System (LGERS) as well as several supplemental plans. After fully funding the OPEB annual required contribution (ARC) in fiscal 2014, the city has scaled back funding. During fiscal 2016, the city funded about 85% of the OPEB ARC. The city plans to continue to fund OPEB on a pay-go basis.
Long-Term Liability Burden
Overall debt and unfunded pension liabilities are low at approximately 1% of the city's personal income, excluding self-supporting enterprise debt. About 67% of the city's overall debt reflects the overlapping debt of Wilson County. The majority of the city's future capital needs will be paid on a pay-go basis, including an increase in the city's occupancy tax. No new debt issuances are planned. All outstanding debt (excluding self-supporting debt) is amortized within five years.
City employees participate in LGERS, which is administrated by the state. The system is funded at 96% based on a Fitch-adjusted 7% return assumption. The city also participates in the Law Enforcement Officers' Special Separation Allowance plan, which it has been funding on a pay-go basis. The unfunded liability for both plans is minimal. The city's unfunded OPEB liability of $41.9 million is modest, accounting for about 2% of personal income.
Operating Performance
Given the city's superior inherent budget flexibility in the form of control over revenues and spending capacity, Fitch expects the city to manage through economic downturns while maintaining a high level of fundamental financial flexibility. Reserves are expected to remain above the city's 25% policy and well above what Fitch believes is needed throughout economic cycles to maintain exceptional gap-closing capacity. The unrestricted general fund balance of nearly $20 million in fiscal 2016 was a high 42% of spending. The city's reserve required by state statute, which is primarily to offset accounts receivable, is an additional source of financial flexibility and increases the total available fund balance to $24 million or 51%.
The city proved its financial resilience and strong budget management through the most recent recession by deferring capital purchases and projects and reducing staff through attrition. Fitch expects the city to make similar operational changes as needed during a future economic downturn.
The fiscal 2017 general fund budget of $47.9 million is about a 5% increase over the original fiscal 2016 budget. The fiscal 2017 budget includes a four-cent tax rate increase reflecting an estimated 8% decline in AV following the recent reassessment of taxable property within the city; this will be the first tax rate increase since 2007. The budget also includes a $3.95 million fund balance appropriation. Given the city's over a decade long history of not using appropriated fund balance, Fitch expects operations to be positive relative to budget.
