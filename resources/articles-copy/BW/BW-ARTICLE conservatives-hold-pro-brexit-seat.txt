Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservative Party held the eastern English district of Sleaford in a House of Commons by-election forced after one of her lawmakers resigned over her handling of the U.K.’s departure from the European Union.
Caroline Johnson, a local doctor, won 17,570 votes, with the U.K. Independence Party’s Victoria Ayling polled 4,426 votes in second place, according to the BBC. UKIP was aiming to eat into the Conservatives’ majority in the constituency, where May’s party won 56 percent of the vote in last year’s general election compared to UKIP’s 16 percent, by pledging to force Britain into a “hard” Brexit.

Voters in the constituency backed leaving the EU by 62 percent in the June referendum. The vote was the second electoral test of May’s strategy in a week after voters in Richmond, southwest London, backed a Liberal Democrat who promised to do everything she can to keep Britain in the bloc.
Tory lawmaker Stephen Phillips quit as member of the Commons for Sleaford on Nov. 4, citing “irreconcilable policy differences” with May over her wish to exit the bloc without going through Parliament. A lawyer who had campaigned for Brexit, his resignation came on the day the Daily Mail newspaper denounced as “Enemies of the People” three judges who ruled the government would need parliamentary approval to trigger the divorce.
