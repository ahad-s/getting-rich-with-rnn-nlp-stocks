According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the backlog figure from the third quarter of 2015 was a result of the timing of several large orders placed in that quarter; (2) the backlog figure for the third quarter of 2016 would not be close to the backlog figure of the third quarter of 2015; and (3) as a result, Defendants’ public statements about Supreme Industries’ business, operations and prospects were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damage.
A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than January 3, 2017.
