SAO PAULO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Fitch Ratings has affirmed the long-term rating assigned to Energia Eolica S.A.'s (Inka) USD204 million senior notes maturing in 2034 at 'BBB-'. The Outlook has been revised to Positive from Stable.
The Outlook revision reflects the project's positive performance in terms of consolidated energy output, at levels above P50 since reaching commercial operation in September 2014, above Fitch's base case expectation. To a lesser extent, the revision also incorporates the project's actual operating expense figures, also below budgeted amounts. A third year of consecutive operating and financial performance above base case expectations may lead to a revision of Fitch's key long-term assumptions, including energy generation haircuts and operating expense budgets.
The rating is driven by Inka's adequate wind certification study, which includes reliable results for long-term correlation, further supported by actual generation levels above P50 until September 2016. The transaction benefits from a 20-year fixed-price power purchase agreement (PPA) with Peru's energy system operator which is partially offset by some curtailment risk as more renewable projects connect to the grid. Stable rating case debt service coverage ratios (DSCRs), averaging 1.34x, are consistent with 'BBB' category ratings.
KEY RATING DRIVERS
Moderate Operational Risk: Operation Risk - Midrange:
The rating reflects the risks associated with the operations of wind farm facilities over a 20-year term. Favorably, the project benefits from proven turbine technology and initial operating support from the manufacturer. Plant performance should experience low variability, as Vestas will initially operate the turbines under a 10-year agreement. A six-month operating and maintenance reserve provides short-term liquidity for unanticipated cost escalations.
Low-Variability Wind Resource: Revenue Risk - Volume - Midrange:
Site wind measurements for initial certification were recorded for 5.5 years at one meteorological tower (Mast Talara-1) and 3.75 years at another (Mast Talara-2). The project is located on a flat terrain. Data was long-term correlated with nearby Guayaquil Aeropuerto dataset, MERRA, WindTrends and Reanalysis-2. The independent engineer (IE) opined the long-term hub-height wind speeds estimates are reasonable and that the AWS Truepower model appears to have performed reasonably well at project sites. P50 levels were estimated based on accepted methods. In 2016, AWS revised initial P50 estimates, increasing output by 1.3%.
Fully Contracted Production: Revenue Risk - Price - Midrange:
A 20-year fixed-price PPA with the Peruvian electric grid as off-taker accounts for 100% of the project's generated revenues, which is viewed as a systemic risk, and with credit quality of that of the sovereign (Peru: Long-Term Issuer Default Rating 'BBB+'/Outlook Stable). The project is exposed to penalties to the extent annual energy production falls below a certain threshold. As a partial offset, the concession allows for a one-time reduction in energy production during a four-year period to minimize future penalties. Curtailment risk is low in the intermediate term but could rise as the country derives an increasing share of energy from renewable sources.
Manageable Debt Structure: Debt Structure - Midrange:
The rated debt is fixed-rate, fully amortizing through 2034. The structure includes a six-month debt service reserve account and three-month O&M reserve, providing for adequate liquidity. Distribution lock-up triggers are adequate incentives, set at 1.20x DSCR.
Adequate Financial Coverage
DSCR levels under the base case (P50 adjusted for a 4% haircut) average 1.84x with a minimum of 1.76x. Under the rating case (1YR P90 adjusted for a 4% haircut), DSCRs average 1.34x with a minimum of 1.30x. The resulting coverages fit will within criteria guidance of 1.30x for 'BBB' category ratings.
Peer Analysis
Inka's credit metrics are closely comparable with Mexican projects Oaxaca II and Oaxaca IV, both rated 'BBB-'/Outlook Positive. Key rating factor assessments for the three projects are the same, all at midrange levels. Oaxaca II minimum and average DSCRs are 1.30x and 1.35x, while Oaxaca IV's minimum and average DSCRs are 1.33x and 1.36x.
RATING SENSITIVITIES
Positive
--Energy generation levels at or above P50 for a third consecutive year, combined with stability in operating expenses.
Negative
--Energy production consistently underperforming 1yr. P90 levels;
--Operating expenses that are persistently higher than Fitch's rating case projections leading to a deterioration in DSCR to below 1.30x under the rating case;
--Downgrade of Peru's Long-Term IDR below 'BBB-,' reflective of potential deterioration of the system's ability to honor foreign currency PPA obligations.
The notes are mainly secured by a first-priority interest in the collateral, which includes a pledge on all capital stock of the issuer, all project documents, all existing and future tangible and intangible assets of the issuer, all revenue, project, collateral, reserve accounts, and cash or cash-equivalents maintained in the accounts.
CREDIT UPDATE
Energia Eolica S.A. (the project) consists of two wind farms located in the coastal areas of northwestern Peru. The Cupisnique and Talara wind farms have a combined nameplate capacity of 114.035 MW. Overall, the project contains 45 Vestas V-100 (1.8 MW) for Cupisnique and 17 Vestas V-100 (1.8 MW). Project started operations in September 2014 and is owned and sponsored by ContourGlobal.
Vestas is also the O&M provider under a 10-year agreement for a full scope of scheduled and unforeseen maintenance. After the 10-year period, ContourGlobal plans to take over O&M for the remaining life of the concession. The project's 20-year fixed-price contract with the system operator requires Cupisnique to generate 303 GWh/yearly (Capacity Factor 41.6%) and for Talara to generate 119.7 GWh/yearly (Capacity Factor 44.2%).
As of September 2016, the power outputs of both Talara and Cupisnique were slightly higher than P50 levels, reaching 96.3 GWh and 241.2 GWh, respectively; thus, above Fitch's base case. Base case assumptions consider productions levels at P50, while Fitch's rating case considers 1 yr. P90 wind production. Wind generation levels in both cases are adjusted for a 4% haircut over the life of the rated notes.
Average availability levels for both projects were well above Fitch's base case, reaching 99.3% for Talara and 99.5% in the case of Cupisnique.
Throughout 2016, the project benefited from an inflow of USD11.1 million from past invoiced PPA Premiums recognized previously in the balance sheet as accrued revenues. As of September 2016, the accrued revenues balance is USD3.8 million.
Revenue collection is expected to stabilize in the future.
The project's cash flow generation in 2016 and, consequently, average quarterly DSCRs reached 2.23x, above Fitch's base case projections of 1.87x. Higher revenues, due to stronger winds in the region, coupled with lower operating costs and expenses resulted in cash flow after debt service of USD18.9 million.
The issuer distributed USD18 million to the sponsor, having complied with the covenant of 1.20x. As of September 2016, final unrestricted cash balances and reserve accounts totaled USD10.2 million.
