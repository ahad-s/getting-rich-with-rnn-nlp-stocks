SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
With holiday travel season fast approaching, QuoteWizard (quotewizard.com), an online insurance comparison marketplace, today released a proprietary study ranking the best and worst driving states in the nation (https://quotewizard.com/news/posts/the-best-and-worst-drivers-by-state).
From worst to best, here are the rankings of all 50 states: https://quotewizard.com/news/posts/the-best-and-worst-drivers-by-state. Among its findings, QuoteWizard found that the nation’s best drivers are in Rhode Island, Florida, and Mississippi, while the three worst driving states are in Utah, California, and Virginia.
In addition to providing an indication of how all 50 states rate, the study also addresses some longstanding rivalries, such as:
“If you’ve ever been cut off by someone with an out-of-state plate and thought, ‘Oh, it figures,’ this study may be for you,” said Adam Johnson, QuoteWizard content manager. “QuoteWizard analyzed millions of datapoints on drivers from throughout the US and what we found provides a pretty interesting and sometimes surprising snapshot of the best and worst drivers in America.”
Methodology
QuoteWizard sampled incident data (with more than 2 million data points) from drivers who used its services and linearly extrapolated it to Federal Highway Administration fatality data. To quantify overall driver standards for comparison, QuoteWizard then weighted various incident counts for each state with its occurrence percentage. The final rankings are a sum of weighted means which is calculated from total accidents, speeding tickets, DUI, citations and fatalities.
