SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Edgewater Networks, the leader in Network Edge Orchestration, today announced that it has completed interoperability testing of its EdgeMarc Intelligent Edges with Metaswitch’s Multimedia Telephony Application Server (MTAS) to obtain Metaswitch Mosaic Partner Certification.
