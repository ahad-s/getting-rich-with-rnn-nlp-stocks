NO CLASS HAS YET BEEN CERTIFIED IN THE ABOVE ACTION. UNTIL A CLASS IS CERTIFIED, YOU ARE NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL UNLESS YOU RETAIN ONE. YOU MAY ALSO REMAIN AN ABSENT CLASS MEMBER AND DO NOTHING AT THIS POINT. YOU MAY RETAIN COUNSEL OF YOUR CHOICE.
According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) TerraVia’s products caused gastrointestinal distress, such as nausea and vomiting; and (2) as a result, Defendants’ statements about TerraVia’s business, operations, and prospects were false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. On November 7, 2016, Bloomberg reported that TerraVia sent a letter to a distributor in July warning that TerraVia had received reports showing that algal protein can cause gastrointestinal distress. On this news, shares of TerraVia fell $0.15 per share or over 8% to close at $1.70 per share on November 7, 2016, damaging investors.
