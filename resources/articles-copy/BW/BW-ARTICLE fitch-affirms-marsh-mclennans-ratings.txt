CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Fitch Ratings has affirmed Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.'s (MMC) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and existing senior unsecured debt ratings at 'A-' and short-term ratings at 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release.
KEY RATING DRIVERS
The ratings affirmation reflects MMC's continued strong balance sheet, financial flexibility and excellent operating performance. Fitch expects that MMC's key credit ratios will continue to approximate recent levels over the next 12-24 months.
The rating rationale also considers MMC's top-tier competitive position as one of the world's largest diversified services firms, with major operations in insurance brokerage and consulting.
Partially offsetting these favorable factors is the fact that, similar to other insurance brokers that Fitch rates, MMC faces contingent risks, including reputational risk and as an occasional target of litigation and regulatory actions that can have a financial impact.
The company reported $1.4 billion of cash and equivalents at Sept. 30, 2016 and also maintains a $1.5 billion multi-currency unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in 2020. Fitch expects free cash flow (FCF) to continue increasing over time due in part to expense reductions and projected earnings growth. Favorably, restructuring expenses have recently been immaterial, and share repurchases are considered to be discretionary in order to preserve liquidity ($625 million repurchased through nine months ending Sept. 30, 2016 compared to $1.4 billion repurchased in all of 2015).
MMC's consolidated EBIT operating margin, debt-to-EBITDA ratio, and EBITDA-to interest coverage ratios have each been consistently strong and are projected to remain so. Given prospects for further solid earnings growth through year-end 2016 and 2017, Fitch expects these key metrics to remain well within guidelines for the current rating category. The ratings continue to reflect a continued trend of improved operating performance and stronger credit metrics that has persisted for several years.
The company has successfully demonstrated consistent and material key credit metric improvement over the past several years. At TTM Sept. 30, 2016, EBITDA-to-interest coverage was excellent at over 16x, and financial leverage as measured by debt-to-EBITDA remained moderate at 1.5x, within Fitch's expectations for the rating.
MMC has sustained improved performance levels due in part to a largely stable commercial pricing environment, an improving global macroeconomic environment, and reduced expenses. For the first nine months of 2016, MMC's Fitch-calculated consolidated operating EBIT margin was solid at 21%, an improvement over 19% at year-end 2015. Both the company's Risk & Insurance Services (RIS) and Consulting segments reported organic revenue growth and year-over-year margin expansion.
Looking forward, operating results could benefit from underlying insured exposure growth derived from a modestly growing global economy. Exposure growth benefits are partially offset by some weakening primary insurance market pricing and significant rate softening in many reinsurance lines. These trends should have a modest net favorable impact on top-line growth in both MMC's RIS and Consulting segments.
The affirmation of MMC's 'F2' short-term ratings is based on its 'A-' Long-Term IDR and continues to reflect the strong liquidity position and supporting contingency programs, and proven access to the capital markets.
RATING SENSITIVITIES
Key rating triggers that could lead to a downgrade if observed over a sustained period of time include:
--Debt-to-EBITDA exceeding 2x; and
--EBITDA-to-interest expense coverage deteriorating to levels below 10x; or
--If MMC incurred material charges arising from litigation or regulatory rulings that could affect long-term performance;
--If MMC were to report a material goodwill impairment that casts doubt on its ability to generate future earnings and cash flows.
Key rating triggers that could lead to an upgrade if observed over a sustained period of time include:
--Consolidated EBIT operating margins of 20% or better;
--Debt-to-EBITDA approaching 1.2x;
--EBITDA-to-interest expense in excess of 18x.

The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete.

In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.

Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee.
