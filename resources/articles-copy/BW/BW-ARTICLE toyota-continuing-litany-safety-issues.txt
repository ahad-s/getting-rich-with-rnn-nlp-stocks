BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
In recent years, Toyota has been at the center of a seemingly-endless string of safety problems, resulting in recalls and litigation, according to Gilman Law LLP. These controversies have included vehicles prone to unintended acceleration, an expanded recall of 5 million faulty airbags, and brake safety problems. Just last month, Toyota acknowledged dangerous corrosion problems affecting many of its Tacoma, Tundra and Sequoia sport utility vehicles. Days later, the Company announced a recall for 2016 Toyota Sienna minivans because the sliding doors could open while the vehicle is moving.
“The never-ending safety controversies affecting Toyota vehicles are bad enough on their own. However, the company’s treatment of consumers makes these issues even worse,” says Ken Gilman, founding partner at Gilman Law LLP. “For example, a $3 billion settlement recently announced by Toyota to resolve this massive corrosion problem falls far short of what is required.”
Toyota Corrosion Settlement
On November 9th, 2016, Toyota announced a $3.4 billion settlement after many of its Tacoma, Tundra and Sequoia sport utility vehicles were found to lack adequate rust protection, resulting in premature corrosion. While the settlement covers 1.5 million vehicles, it only applies to Toyota Tacoma trucks from model years 2005 to 2010, Tundras from 2007 to 2008 and Sequoias from 2005 to 2008. The agreement fails to compensate owners and prior owners of Tundras except for years 2007 – 2008 and no other affected years. It also fails to compensate owners for many years of affected Tacoma and Sequoia vehicles.
“Owners should seek a review of their claims for compensation relating to corroded frames and other major corrosion issues which they have experienced,” Mr. Gilman says. “Tundra, Tacoma and Sequoia vehicles have experienced severe frame and other corrosion issues that may impact the structural integrity of the vehicles. Affected consumers are urged to seek a review of their claims.”
Recent Toyota Recalls
On October 12, 2016, Toyota announced a recall for 340,000 Toyota Prius sedans due to a potentially deadly brake defect. The recall affects 92,000 2016 and 2017 models sold in the U.S. The company also acknowledged receiving reports of crashes, injuries and deaths that could be related to this issue. There is a possibility that the parking brake on the affected vehicles could become inoperative. If this occurs and the driver exits the vehicle with the transmission in a gear other than "Park" while the ignition is on, the vehicle could roll away, increasing the risk of a crash.
On November 22, 2016, Toyota recalled 744,000 Model Year 2011 – 2016 Toyota Sienna minivans because the sliding doors could open while the vehicle is moving. Toyota still does not have a remedy to fix the problem.
