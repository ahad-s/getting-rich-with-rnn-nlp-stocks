Chancellor Angela Merkel called for a ban on full-face coverings for women in Germany, prompting applause from members of her party.
Clarifying for the first time her position on the issue, Merkel sided with officials within her Christian Democratic Union who this year called for such a ban, which would pertain to clothing such as burqas.
“Full-facial covering is not inappropriate with us -- it should be banned,” Merkel told delegates at the CDU convention in Essen, Germany, on Tuesday. “Sometimes one has the impression people who have already been living in Germany for a long time also need an integration course.”
