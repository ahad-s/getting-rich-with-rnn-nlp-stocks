MCLEAN, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), a leading technology integrator providing full life cycle services and solutions in the technical, engineering, intelligence, and enterprise information technology markets, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended November 4, 2016.
“SAIC’s third quarter performance delivered strong results in profitability, cash flow generation and business development,” said Tony Moraco, SAIC Chief Executive Officer. “With our highest book-to-bill since separation, our business development activities continue to gain momentum. Our continued investments position us well to meet the mission of our customers, execute our strategy and create shareholder value.”
Revenues for the third quarter were $1,114 million compared to $1,136 million during the prior year quarter, which represents a decrease of $22 million. Newly awarded programs, such as the Amphibious Combat Vehicle and GSA Enterprise Operations, generated revenues of $47 million during the current quarter. This increase was offset by lower material volume on DoD, federal civilian agency and supply chain programs ($39 million), the expected decline in activity on the Assault Amphibious Vehicle (AAV) program as we near the completion of the prototyping phase ($4 million) and various other decreases across our contract portfolio due to programs that have ended or have experienced lower activity.
Operating income for the quarter was $74 million, or 6.6% of revenues, up from 5.6% for the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to lower intangible asset amortization ($5 million), higher net favorable changes in estimates on contracts accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method ($4 million), lower employee benefits expense and a decrease in acquisition and integration costs. These increases were partially offset by increased spending on independent research and development projects and bid and proposal activity.
Net income for the quarter increased $8 million from the comparable prior year period primarily due to increased operating income ($7 million, net of tax) and a lower effective tax rate ($2 million) primarily due to increased research and development credits in the current year. These increases were partially offset by increased interest expense due to costs associated with the amendment to our credit facility.
EBITDA(1) was $86 million for the quarter, or 7.7% of revenues, compared to EBITDA(1) of 7.1% in the comparable prior year quarter. The increase was due to an increase in net favorable changes in estimates on contracts accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method and lower employee benefits expense.
Diluted earnings per share was $0.91 for the quarter. The weighted-average diluted shares outstanding during the quarter was 45.6 million shares.
Cash Generation and Capital Deployment
Total cash flows provided by operating activities for the quarter were $153 million, an increase of $85 million from the comparable prior year period. The increase in operating cash flows over the prior year period was primarily due to a net reduction in working capital investments in Marine Corps platform integration and IT services programs ($39 million) and one less payroll payment in the current quarter.
During the quarter SAIC deployed $54 million of capital, consisting of $14 million in cash dividends and $40 million in plan share repurchases (607 thousand shares) under SAIC’s previously announced share repurchase program.
New Business Awards
Net bookings for the quarter were approximately $1.9 billion, which reflects a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.7. SAIC’s estimated backlog of signed business orders at the end of the quarter was approximately $8.2 billion of which $2.0 billion was funded.
SAIC was awarded the following notable contracts during the quarter:
Defense Logistics Agency (DLA): SAIC was awarded a fixed-price, single award, indefinite-quantity contract by the DLA to continue to deliver chemicals, packaged petroleum, oils and lubricants. The contract has a five-year base period of performance, one three-year option and one two-year option for a total contract value of approximately $1.4 billion if all options are exercised.
U.S. Army – US Army Engineering and Support Center: SAIC was awarded the High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) Integrated Technical Services (HITS) task order by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. SAIC will provide program management and technical support to the HPCMP supercomputing centers. SAIC also will provide systems engineering and technical support to repair, modernize, improve and acquire HPCMP and Department of Defense Supercomputing Resource Center assets and capabilities. The task order has a one-year base period of performance and four one-year options for a total task order value of approximately $575 million if all options are exercised.
U.S. Navy – U.S. Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA): SAIC was awarded a contract by NAVSEA to manufacture MK 48 Mod 7 heavyweight torpedo afterbody and tailcone sections. The contract has a 27-month base period of performance from award to final acceptance and includes options for the procurement of spares, production support material, engineering services, test equipment design and manufacturing, and hardware repair services. The total contract value is expected to be approximately $380 million if all options are exercised.
U.S. Intelligence Community: SAIC was awarded contracts and task orders valued at approximately $149 million, if all options are exercised, by U.S. national security and Intelligence Community customers.
