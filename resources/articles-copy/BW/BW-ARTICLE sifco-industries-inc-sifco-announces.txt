Fiscal Year
Fourth Quarter
CEO Peter W. Knapper stated, “We appreciate the continued strong support of our shareholders as we went through a difficult year in fiscal 2016. The leadership team recognizes that our performance must improve. During the fourth quarter, we focused on a number of projects to improve performance as we move forward into fiscal 2017. These include: completing and implementing a new credit facility which will provide us with the resources needed to invest in our operations, making significant progress on the consolidation of our operations from Long Beach and Colorado Springs to our Orange location, and improving our delivery performance to our customers. We have also made the decision to reduce our Board size by two, to a total of seven members. John Chapman and Mike Lipscomb will not be returning in 2017. We all sincerely appreciate the service and contributions that John and Mike have afforded SIFCO over the past number of years, and we wish them all the best. Continuing to improve our operational and financial performance will be our focus as we move forward. Our target markets, both Aerospace and Energy, remain strong and SIFCO is committed to driving improved profitability and growth in fiscal 2017 and forward."
