BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
CYBEX, the award-winning child safety and lifestyle brand for parents, announces two test winners in the Autumn 2016 European car seat test from the prestigious Stiftung Warentest, as well as an ADAC Best in Category honor. The winning car seats, the Aton Q i-Size and the Sirona M2 i-Size, were measured against 16 car seats from different brands, and were tested for safety, handling, ergonomics and harmful substances. While the i-Size models are available only in Europe, CYBEX currently offers an American version of this award-winning Aton Q, and is introducing the Sirona M to American consumers in early 2017. In keeping with the brand’s D.S.F. Innovation Principle, all CYBEX products combine German engineering and distinctive design with superior safety, quality, and ingenious functionality.
“Child safety is our top priority. This sensational result once again confirms our conviction that the successful collaboration between our developers, designers and consumers gives rise to car seats that meet the highest possible safety standards, which are over and above all national legal requirements,” explains Johannes Schlamminger, CEO of CYBEX. “The aim to develop car seats that bring together the best in safety and quality, as well as unique design and intelligent functionality, will remain the focus of CYBEX’s work long into the future.”
CYBEX Aton Q i-Size
The Aton Q i-Size is the latest member of the award-winning Aton family. Previously, the Aton Q was chosen as a test winner from Stiftung Warentest in June 2014. Offering the highest level of safety possible for your child, the Aton Q i- Size complies with the new i-Size regulation.
CYBEX Sirona M2 i-Size
The new Sirona M2 i-Size allows parents to transport children rear-facing from birth up to four years old. The rearward-facing seat significantly reduces the risk of injury in a front collision compared to a conventional forward-facing seat with a 5-point harness-system, as the force of an impact is distributed evenly over a large area. As an option, the Sirona M2 i-Size can also be used as a forward-facing car seat for children who are at least 16 months old and 30 inches in height. CYBEX recommends using the Sirona M2 i-Size rearward-facing as long as possible, ideally up to age four.
