The new MOSFETs utilize Toshiba’s latest generation low-voltage trench structure U-MOS IX-H process to achieve the industry’s leading-class[1] low on-resistance and high-speed performance. The new structure lowers the performance index for “RDS(ON) * Qsw”[2], improving switching applications to a level surpassing current Toshiba products[3]. Output loss is improved by the reduction of output charge, which can contribute to higher set efficiency. Furthermore, the cell structures used in the new MOSFETs are optimized to suppress spike voltage and ringing during switching, which can contribute to lowering set EMI.
