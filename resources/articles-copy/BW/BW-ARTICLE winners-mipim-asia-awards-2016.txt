PARIS & HONG KONG--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
MIPIM Asia, the annual property leaders’ summit in Asia Pacific, announces the final ranking for the 2016 MIPIM Asia Awards.
MIPIM Asia Gold, Silver and Bronze winners were unveiled at the MIPIM Asia Awards Gala Dinner, which was held at Grand Hyatt Hong Kong on 30 November, 2016. Setting the benchmark for excellence in the property industry, the MIPIM Asia Awards are known for recognising the best projects in the Asia Pacific region across 12 distinctive categories. Guest of Honour Mrs Carrie Lam, Chief Secretary for Administration of the HKSAR Government, presented the awards for the Best Retail Development category.
With MIPIM Asia delegates being able to vote for their favourite projects for the first time, the international jury also recognised that the projects were scrutinised closer than ever.
Filippo Rean, Head of Reed MIDEM’s Real Estate Division, said “The MIPIM Asia Awards continue to showcase the magnificence and creativity of architectural projects in the region. This year in particular, we saw how architecture blends with technology in an unprecedented way as developers and architects expand their design options through the innovative use of building materials, aided by new technologies. Furthermore, there is an increased awareness around accessibility for the large scale mixed-use developments, a sign of changing lifestyles that we already see shaping the workplace environment.”
The gala marked the 10th consecutive year for the MIPIM Asia Awards, and concluded the two-day MIPIM Asia Summit. The final ranking of the 36 awarded projects across 12 distinct categories is listed below.
