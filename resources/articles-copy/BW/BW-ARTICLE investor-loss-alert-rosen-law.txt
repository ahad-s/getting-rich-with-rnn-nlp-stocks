NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, announces it is investigating potential securities claims on behalf of shareholders of Universal Health Services, Inc. (UHS) resulting from allegations that Universal Health may have issued materially misleading business information to the investing public.
On December 7, 2016, BuzzFeed published a report detailing its year-long investigation into Universal Health, which was “…based on interviews with 175 current and former UHS staff, including 18 executives who ran UHS hospitals; more than 120 additional interviews with patients, government investigators, and other experts; and a cache of internal documents.” The report stated that “[c]urrent and former employees from at least 10 UHS hospitals in nine states said they were under pressure to fill beds by almost any method – which sometimes meant exaggerating people’s symptoms or twisting their words to make them seem suicidal – and to hold them until their insurance payments ran out.” On this news, shares of Universal Health fell $15.01 per share or nearly 12% to close at $111.36 per share on December 7, 2016.
Rosen Law Firm is preparing a class action lawsuit to recover losses suffered by Universal Health investors.
