Leung Chun-ying won’t seek a second term as Hong Kong’s chief executive, citing family reasons, after a tenure marked by the rise of a new, more confrontational independence movement.
“I have the responsibilities as a father and as a husband,” Leung told reporters Friday, adding, “The central government is very supportive of my work.”
Leung’s first five years have seen growing dissatisfaction with China’s stewardship of the former British colony, including the 2014 Occupy protests and the rise of groups seeking a sharper break with China. In recent weeks he’s moved to rid the Legislative Council of opposition lawmakers who advocate independence or self-determination in a campaign his detractors say was designed to curry favor with his masters in Beijing.
While Leung has received support from Communist Party leaders, he’s struggled with job approval and saw the pro-democracy opposition gain seats in legislative elections Sept. 4, with almost one-fifth of voters backing candidates who want Hong Kong to determine its own relationship with China.
