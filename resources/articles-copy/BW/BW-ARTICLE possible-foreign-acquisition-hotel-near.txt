LONG BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Congressman Alan Lowenthal (CA-47) yesterday wrote to Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew requesting a national security review of the potential sale of the Westin Long Beach hotel to entities tied to foreign states. An excerpt of the letter is below, and click here for the full letter.
“I write regarding the Westin Long Beach hotel, which is located in my district, the California 47th. I understand that the hotel is for sale, and request that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”) review the hotel’s potential sale to companies tied to China or other foreign states. This matter is time sensitive. CFIUS should take the opportunity to ensure national security questions are answered before the transaction has been finalized.”
“The sale of the Westin Long Beach raises national security questions because the hotel is next door to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection – Los Angeles/Long Beach Sea Port office, which handles sensitive information related to interstate commerce, and because the hotel’s clients have included the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, some of which hosted representatives of foreign governments.”
“I urge CFIUS to review this transaction and any other real estate or corporate transaction in my district that poses a national security risk, whether due to proximity to the Port of Long Beach, military bases or other federal infrastructure, harboring sensitive customer information, or hosting meetings with representatives of foreign governments.”
