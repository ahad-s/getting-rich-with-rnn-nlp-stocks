CAMBRIDGE, Mass. & SUMMIT, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Acceleron Pharma Inc. (XLRN) and Celgene Corporation (CELG) today announced Phase 2 results from an open-label three-month base study and the ongoing long-term safety extension study with luspatercept in patients with beta-thalassemia during an oral presentation at the 58th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) in San Diego, California. Luspatercept is being developed as part of the global collaboration between Acceleron and Celgene.
“Beta-thalassemia is a severe, chronic disease with no pharmaceutical treatment options to correct or improve the underlying anemia in patients,” said Michael Pehl, President, Hematology and Oncology for Celgene. “These longer term luspatercept Phase 2 data are encouraging, and we are continuing to enroll patients in the Phase 3 BELIEVE study in transfusion dependent beta-thalassemia patients.”
Luspatercept Beta-Thalassemia Data Presented at ASH
Results in Transfusion Dependent (TD) Beta-Thalassemia Patients
Results in Non-Transfusion Dependent (NTD) Beta-Thalassemia Patients
In the long-term extension study, the median duration of a hemoglobin increase ≥ 1.0 g/dL maintained for at least 12 weeks in responders is 13.5 months (N=21) with treatment still ongoing.
Safety
Luspatercept is an investigational product that is not approved for use in any country.
The BELIEVE Trial, a global Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study in transfusion dependent beta-thalassemia patients, is currently enrolling.
The slides from the ASH beta-thalassemia presentation will be available immediately following the presentation at the conference on Acceleron's website (www.acceleronpharma.com) under the Science tab.
About the Phase 2 Study
Data from two open-label Phase 2 studies were presented at the conference: the base study in which patients received treatment with luspatercept for three months and the ongoing long-term safety extension study in which patients may receive treatment with luspatercept for up to an additional five years. In both the three-month base study and the long-term extension study, red blood cell (RBC) transfusion dependent patients (≥ 4 units RBC / 8 weeks) and non-transfusion dependent patients (< 4 units RBC / 8 weeks) were enrolled and treated with open-label luspatercept, dosed subcutaneously once every three weeks.
The primary outcome measure of the three-month base study was the proportion of patients who have an erythroid response, defined as 1) a hemoglobin increase of ≥ 1.5 g/dL from baseline for ≥ 14 days (in the absence of RBC transfusions) in non-transfusion dependent patients, or 2) ≥ 20% reduction in RBC transfusion burden compared to pretreatment in transfusion dependent patients. The primary outcome for the long-term extension study is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of luspatercept.
About Luspatercept
Luspatercept is a modified activin receptor type IIB fusion protein that acts as a ligand trap for members in the Transforming Growth Factor-Beta (TGF-beta) superfamily involved in the late stages of erythropoiesis (red blood cell production). Luspatercept regulates late-stage erythrocyte (red blood cell) precursor cell differentiation and maturation. This mechanism of action is distinct from that of erythropoietin (EPO), which stimulates the proliferation of early-stage erythrocyte precursor cells. Acceleron and Celgene are jointly developing luspatercept as part of a global collaboration. Acceleron and Celgene are enrolling Phase 3 clinical trials that are designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of luspatercept in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (the “MEDALIST” study) and in patients with beta-thalassemia (the “BELIEVE” study).
