DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Global Mining Laboratory Automation Solutions Market 2016-2020" report to their offering.
The report forecasts the global mining laboratory automation solutions market to grow at a CAGR of 0.15% during the period 2016-2020.
The automation of laboratory functions in the mining industry reduces the requirement of human labor in the work environment, reducing human errors. Automation not only lowers errors but also improves efficiency and accuracy in most cases. Analytical instrument manufacturers have started providing complete analytical solutions instead of just instruments. Hyphenation, the combination of one or more functions into a single container, is another trend that vendors have started to address. It often requires two or more individual instruments to be built under a single casing so that they can work in tandem.
The report covers the present scenario and the growth prospects of the global mining laboratory automation solutions market for 2016-2020. To calculate the market size, the report considers the revenue generated from sales of hardware and software licenses, upgrades of existing solutions, and maintenance and services for calculating laboratory automation solutions market value in the mining industry.
