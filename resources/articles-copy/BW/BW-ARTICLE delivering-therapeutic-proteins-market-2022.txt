DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "The Market for Delivering Therapeutic Proteins, 2016-2022" report to their offering.
Led by the proliferation of antibody-based drugs and candidates, biological drugs as a class continue to outpace all other NCEs in development pipelines and clinical trials. This shift away from small molecule drugs is creating opportunities for drug developers, device designers, packagers and - ultimately - pharmaceutical marketers.
Because biological drugs most often target chronic conditions, dosing strategies and treatment protocols must be developed for long-term use, often for self-administration by patients who may have limitations directly related to their condition. The powerful physiological effects of antibodies, hormones, enzymes and other biological drugs also increase the need for safety and adherence.
