The pound’s rally to a two-month high is masking an incoming blot on traders’ radars.
The currency’s implied volatility curve, an indication of anticipated price swings, shows a jump between the three- and four-month measures -- a period that encompasses Prime Minister Theresa May’s self-imposed deadline to trigger formal negotiations for the nation’s exit from the European Union. That kink represents concerns of heightened volatility for sterling, which remains 2016’s worst-performing major currency following the U.K.’s June vote for Brexit.
“There’s definitely going to be more volatility,” said Derek Halpenny, European head of global markets research at MUFG in London. Volatility rises “when the market is given a specific deadline” and the increase isn’t surprising “given the way sterling has traded on political developments,” he said.
