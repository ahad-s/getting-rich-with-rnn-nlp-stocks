DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Global Premium Water Report 2016" report to their offering.
The sixth global premium bottled water report is the essential guide for anyone in or considering entering, the premium bottled water market. It provides information on developments and trends in premium bottled water, tracks industry challenges and opportunities, and investigates future outlook.
The global premium bottled water market grew strongly in 2015, with sales increasing by 6% - the highest growth rate seen in the last six years. Although growth in the overall packaged water market outpaced that of the premium segment in 2015, premium water has maintained its share of the market due to vast growth in core markets such as Germany and the US.
Premium bottled water sales are dominated by West Europe and North America with the emerging markets of Asia Pacific and the Middle East providing attractive opportunities for a growing number of manufacturers. The rising levels of disposable income in these markets, coupled with the generally poor quality of tap water, serves to increase the appeal of premium water amongst consumers.
This report looks at premium water's place in the market, at both a global and country level. The driving forces behind its growth are examined, and forecasts made for its likely future performance.
