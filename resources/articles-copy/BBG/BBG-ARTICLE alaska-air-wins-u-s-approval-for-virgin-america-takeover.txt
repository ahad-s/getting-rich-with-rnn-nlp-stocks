Alaska Air Group Inc. won U.S. antitrust approval for its acquisition of Virgin America Inc., a takeover that extends years of consolidation in the industry and gives Alaska Air greater access to the lucrative cross-country market.Alaska Air agreed to “substantially reduce” the scope of a codeshare agreement with American Airlines to preserve competition, according to a filing Tuesday in federal court in Washington. The codeshare agreement allows each airline to market tickets for certain flights on the other’s network.The agreement with the Justice Department likely clears the way for the completion of the deal. The combined airline will become the fifth largest in the U.S. based on passenger traffic, displacing JetBlue Airways Corp., which lost to Alaska Air in the bidding to link up with Virgin America.Alaska Air’s $2.6 billion cash agreement to buy Virgin America, announced in April, adds to the string of mergers that have shrunk the number of carriers in the U.S. airline industry since 2005, leaving the top four operators controlling 80 percent of the market.
