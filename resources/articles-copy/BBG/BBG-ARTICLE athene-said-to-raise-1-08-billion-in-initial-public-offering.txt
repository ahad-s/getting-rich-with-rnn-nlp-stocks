At the IPO price, the company is valued at about $7.4 billion, based on about 186 million shares outstanding, according to the deal prospectus.The deal is the third-biggest U.S. offering of the year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Japanese messaging company Line Corp. sold $894.5 million worth of stock in the U.S. and Valvoline Inc. raised $759 million.Under the purview of industry stalwart and Chief Executive Officer Jim Belardi, Athene has become a jewel for Leon Black’s Apollo since the insurer’s founding in 2009. Apollo, which will retain 45 percent of voting power after the IPO, charges fees to help manage the funds.Athene was the seventh-largest seller of fixed annuities in the U.S. in the first nine months of the year, raking in $3.8 billion in sales, according to data from industry group Limra.
