China’s top court has ruled that Michael Jordan has the rights to his last name written in Chinese characters, handing the Hall-of-Fame basketball player a partial victory in his four-year-long legal campaign against a local sportswear-maker.Jordan’s Chinese name is “well-recognized” in China and Fujian province-based Qiaodan Sports Co. Ltd., which operates about 6,000 shops selling shoes and sportswear throughout China, will have to give up its registration of the Chinese version of Qiaodan, pronounced “Chee-ow-dahn,” the Supreme People’s Court said in a verdict issued Thursday that Qiaodan, a family-owned business, had registered the trademark more than a decade ago. Jordan sued the company in 2012, arguing that the company had damaged his legal rights to his name and asking that its trademark registrations be removed. Lower courts have ruled in favor of the Chinese company.“I am happy that the Supreme People’s Court has recognized the right to protect my name through its ruling in the trademark cases,” Jordan said in an e-mailed statement after the ruling. “Chinese consumers deserve to know that Qiaodan Sports and its products have no connection to me.”The court ruled that the trademark for Jordan’s Chinese name should be returned to China’s State Administration for Industry and Commerce to be re-awarded. However, it rejected Jordan’s claim to the romanized, or pinyin, version of the name ‘Qiaodan.’— With assistance by Daniela Wei, Rachel Chang, and Alfred Cang
