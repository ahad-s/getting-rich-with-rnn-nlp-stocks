It’s survived decades of wind, rain and lightning strikes, but now Brazil’s iconic Christ the Redeemer statue is suffering from the same elemental problem as the rest of the country: a lack of cash.On Thursday the archdiocese of Rio de Janeiro launched the ‘Friends of the Christ the Redeemer’ fundraising campaign to preserve the landmark, which draws millions of tourists per year to the top of Corcovado mountain. The 13-story statue that looms over the city isn’t only a symbol of Rio, but of Brazil. Both are suffering with a deep recession that has drained government coffers.Christ the Redeemer statue under maintenance in 2012.“Up until today we’ve counted on the church’s own resources and those of the private sector for maintenance,” Omar Raposo, the priest in charge of the Sanctuary of Christ the Redeemer, told local TV station Globo. “But with this big crisis in which we find ourselves today, we have great concern and need all of society to collaborate."Head of the statue while under maintenance in 2012.Maintenance costs have risen and the economic crisis means the church cannot demand more from its sponsors, which include Mastercard, Samsung, Hyundai and Pirelli, according to Father Marcos William, who is in charge of the archdiocese’s communications.
