Airbus Group SE was selected by the Canadian government to replace its search-and-rescue planes, beating out Leonardo-Finmeccanica SpA in a deal estimated by the previous government at C$3.4 billion ($2.6 billion), according to people familiar with the situation.The deal to replace and maintain Canada’s 19 search-and-rescue planes is set to be announced Thursday, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the details aren’t public. The decision was first reported by the Ottawa Citizen newspaper. The final value of the contract and number of planes isn’t yet clear.Canada’s Public Services and Procurement Minister Judy Foote had committed to announcing the purchase by the end of 2016. A spokesman for the Airbus-led bid referred questions Tuesday to government. A spokeswoman for Foote and spokespeople for the Leonardo-led bid didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment after business hours Tuesday.Jordan Owens, a spokeswoman for Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan, declined to confirm or deny that Airbus had been selected. “We look forward to giving our women and men in uniform the tools they need to continue to deliver effective search and rescue operations‎,” Owens said late Tuesday by e-mail.Embraer SA also bid for the contract, but the race was said to have narrowed to Airbus’s C295 and the C-27J Spartan, produced by a Leonardo-led consortium, because Canada’s government didn’t amend its procurement process to accommodate Embraer’s production schedule. Requests for comment from Embraer weren’t immediately returned late Tuesday.Airbus has teamed up with closely held Provincial Aerospace Ltd. of St. John’s, Newfoundland, as well as Pratt & Whitney Canada -- the engine-making unit of United Technologies Corp. -- and Montreal-based flight simulator maker CAE Inc.The “Team Spartan” consortium includes Leonardo-Finmeccanica, General Dynamics Corp.’s Canadian division and other companies behind the Spartan.
