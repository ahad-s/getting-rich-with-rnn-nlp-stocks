Airbnb Inc. said it has agreed to drop a lawsuit challenging a New York State law imposing penalties on people who post short-term apartment rentals on the site. In exchange, officials said they wouldn’t seek to punish the company itself, something they have said the law was never intended to do anyway. Linda Rosenthal, a state assembly member from Manhattan who has led the effort against Airbnb, described the settlement as full capitulation by the company.“This is an astounding about-face on the part of Airbnb, which clearly recognized that this was a foolhardy and frivolous lawsuit,” she said in an e-mailed statement.Peter Schottenfels, a spokesman for Airbnb, said the settlement will mark the first time the company would be working together with New York City to cut down on illegal activity.“We look forward to using this as a basis to finding an approach that protects responsible New Yorkers while cracking down on illegal hotels that remove permanent housing off the market or create unsafe spaces,” he wrote in an e-mail.In early October, just after the enforcement law was passed in New York, Airbnb instituted a new policy there called “one host, one home.” It promised to help go after people who rent multiple apartments.However, there’s still a difference of opinion about how the law should be enforced. Rosenthal said she expected the city to begin enforcement against “serial lawbreakers.” But it could also be used to punish anyone who lists their own apartment on the service, unless they are physically present during a guest’s stay. Airbnb said officials shouldn’t go after people who rent their primary residences.
