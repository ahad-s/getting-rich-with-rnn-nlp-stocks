French President Francois Hollande said he won’t run for re-election, stunning the nation and opening the way for his more popular prime minister to enter the 2017 presidential race.Hollande made the announcement in a televised address on Thursday evening, saying that his lack of support opened the country to the risk of extremist movements. He becomes the first president since the Fifth Republic began in 1958 not to seek re-election.While Hollande didn’t say who should represent the Socialist Party in next year’s election, the move potentially clears the path for Prime Minister Manuel Valls, who has said he’d run if the president decided against a bid.“I am aware of the risks of a candidacy which would not unite,” Hollande said. “I have decided not to be a candidate.”In his address, which was announced just one hour beforehand, Hollande acknowledged some mistakes, defended his record, and said he was putting the country’s needs ahead of his personal ambition. He warned against the danger of protectionism and of France turning in on itself.Polls show that Hollande or any other Socialist candidate would be eliminated in the April 23 first round of the presidential election. The top two candidates -- which polls suggest will be Francois Fillon from the center-right Republicans Party and Marine Le Pen from the anti-European Union National Front -- face off in a decisive second round on May 7.Plenty of others have already stepped in to try to represent leftist and center-left voters. Jean-Luc Melenchon, a 65-year-old who placed fourth in the 2012 election with 11 percent of the vote, and Emmanuel Macron, a 38-year-old former economy minister in Hollande’s administration, have already said they will run outside of a primary the Socialists and other leftist parties are planning for January. Arnaud Montebourg, a 54-year-old who was economy minister before Macron, has said he’s running within the primary.
