Slim: AT&T; Losing Money With Mexican StrategiesAT&T Inc.’s aggressive pricing strategies in Mexico are causing the company to lose “a lot” of money, said Carlos Slim, the billionaire who controls the phone giant’s biggest rival.“You can see it in their balance sheets,” he said. AT&T’s low-cost plans are taking market share from other competitors but not from Slim’s America Movil SAB, which has responded with its own offers, the Mexican billionaire said. The price war among phone companies in Mexico can’t go on forever, he said, although he’s pleased it has benefited consumers.Slim is right that AT&T operates at a loss in Mexico. Its operating loss widened last quarter to $148 million from $134 million a year earlier. In the country, Dallas-based AT&T offers a 6-gigabyte data, voice and text plan -- including full coverage in the U.S. -- for about $25 a month. The company offers a similar package in the U.S. for $80.An AT&T spokeswoman had no immediate comment.“Competition always makes us better,” Slim said. “They’re looking out for their interests and we’re looking out for ours.”AT&T was once an investor in America Movil, and the U.S. company’s chief executive officer Randall Stephenson, has said he considers Slim a mentor. Slim said he doesn’t consider AT&T’s incursion into Mexico a betrayal by Stephenson.America Movil does have a way to retaliate against AT&T in the U.S. The Mexican company’s American unit, TracFone, is the biggest provider of prepaid service in the country, and could get more aggressive there. But Slim said his strategy for TracFone isn’t changing in the short term, even as the industry changes. “We’ll work on what we’ve been doing, which is making it profitable,” he said.
