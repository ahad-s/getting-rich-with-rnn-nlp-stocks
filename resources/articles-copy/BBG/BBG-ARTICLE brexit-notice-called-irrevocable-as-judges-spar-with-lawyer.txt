Juckes: Brexit an 'Incredible Act of Diplomacy' for MaySupreme Court President David Neuberger said judges deciding a landmark challenge to the government’s Brexit plans are proceeding on the basis that giving formal notice of Britain’s intention to leave the European Union can’t be reversed.“An irrevocable step is going to be made in the form of the Article 50 notice,” Neuberger said on the second day of arguments in the Brexit appeal. Both the government’s case, that it doesn’t need to consult Parliament before notifying the EU, and the legal challenge trying to force a vote, assume that Article 50 is irreversible.Supreme Court is working on assumption that Article 50 is "irrevocable," its president says https://t.co/CmhDEUSdin pic.twitter.com/kvEO8I9Djh

A finance entrepreneur, a hairdresser and a group of Britons living abroad filed a lawsuit to try to force Prime Minister Theresa May to hold a vote before triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. If successful, the case could delay May’s plan to issue the notice as soon as March and hinder the government’s attempts to secure a favorable exit deal. The Supreme Court is expected to make a decision early next year.Ex-Banker Leads Supreme Court Judges Into Brexit BattlegroundThe government argues it has the legal power to leave international treaties without consulting lawmakers and, in any case, Parliament will have to vote on a Great Repeal Bill to replace European laws.James Eadie, a lawyer for the government, told judges that the Article 50 notice itself would not contain any information about the terms of Britain’s departure.“It certainly won’t delve into what the agreement would look like,” he said.On Tuesday morning, the 11 judges asked whether future legislation related to Brexit, such as the proposed repeal bill that would abolish the 1972 European Communities Act that took Britain into the EU, is relevant to questions about the extent of the government’s powers.“It’s valuable to know but it has no legal significance,” Judge Jonathan Sumption said, referring to the repeal bill.Eadie had tried to argue that the repeal bill and other measures guarantee Parliament’s involvement in the Brexit process.“The idea that Parliament will not be involved cannot possibly be sustained,” Eadie said.Wigs, Swords and Pro-EU Dog at Supreme Court Brexit ProtestsWhile the judges sparred with Eadie, EU officials laid out a timetable to negotiate the divorce with the U.K. Michel Barnier, the European Commission’s chief Brexit negotiator, said that if Theresa May is able to trigger Article 50 by her March deadline, an agreement can be finalized by October 2018.The Supreme Court hearings were closely watched by investors who were pinning their hopes that the judges rule against the government. The pound reached a two-month high as traders believe that more parliamentary involvement would reduce the chances of a hard Brexit that would take Britain out of the single market.Eadie faced tough questions for a second day after judges on Monday focused on the fact that lawmakers had approved the 1972 treaty that paved the way for Britain to join the EU, with one jurist calling it a “joint effort.”On Tuesday, Eadie conceded that the U.K. would have to replace “swaths and swaths” of European legislation in areas including equal rights, farming and employment. Asked by Judge Brenda Hale whether he agreed that British citizens’ legal rights would be affected, Eadie said he did and added that the process would be complicated.“The question will then be: how is the government going to shape the new domestic law?” he said. “The answer to that question is policy area by policy area.”
