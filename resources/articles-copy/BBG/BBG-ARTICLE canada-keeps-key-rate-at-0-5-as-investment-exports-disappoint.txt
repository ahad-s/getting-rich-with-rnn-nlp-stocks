Stephen Poloz The Bank of Canada kept its key interest rate unchanged, citing uncertain prospects for a recovery in exports and business investment following the U.S. election.Policy makers maintained the benchmark rate on overnight loans between commercial banks at 0.5 percent, and said a significant amount of slack remains in the nation’s economy, in contrast to the U.S.“Uncertainty, which has been undermining business confidence and dampening investment in Canada’s major trading partners, remains undiminished,” policy makers led by Governor Stephen Poloz said in a statement Wednesday from Ottawa. “There have been ongoing gains in employment, but a significant amount of economic slack remains in Canada, in contrast to the United States.”The decision leaves Canada poised to trail the U.S. Federal Reserve’s benchmark for the first time since 2007 next week when policy makers meet in Washington.Exporters have failed to ride the tailwinds of an American recovery and a weaker currency, while many Alberta energy investments remain unprofitable even with crude oil back at $50 a barrel.The one-page statement dropped any assessment of the balance of risks around the bank’s 2 percent inflation target, and didn’t repeat Poloz’s remarks at an October press conference about considering a rate cut. Since then Poloz had said only a fresh major shock would lead to another reduction.“In Canada, the dynamics of growth are largely as the Bank anticipated,” the statement said. “The Bank’s Governing Council judges that the current stance of monetary policy remains appropriate.”Fiscal stimulus helped consumer spending in the third quarter, but non-energy exports and investment remain disappointing, the bank said.Canada’s economy has showed signs of emerging from the worst damage from a plunge in energy investment, including the fastest output growth in two years last quarter and two months of faster inflation. The world’s 10th largest economy still must navigate a return to full output the bank has said will take until mid-2018.Canada ships three-quarters of its exports to the U.S., making President-elect Donald Trump’s possible mix of fiscal stimulus and trade protectionism a key question north of border.Investors have increased their bets Poloz can avoid a rate cut on the prospect Trump and Congress will authorize new spending and tax cuts. That can help Canada because it’s a major exporter of equipment and raw materials, while at the same time business investment could be slowed by the rise in global yields.“Following the election in the United States, there has been a rapid back-up in global bond yields, partly reflecting market anticipation of fiscal expansion in a U.S. economy that is near full capacity,” the Bank of Canada said today.Twenty-two of 23 economists predicted no move today, and one predicted a quarter-point cut.
