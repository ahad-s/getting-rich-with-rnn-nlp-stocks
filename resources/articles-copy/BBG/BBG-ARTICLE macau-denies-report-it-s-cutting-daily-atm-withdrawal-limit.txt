Macau’s government said the limit on daily cash withdrawals for mainland China-issued ATM cards remains unchanged, while it capped each card transaction at 5,000 patacas ($626), contradicting a South China Morning Post report that the Chinese city was planning to cut daily limits.The daily ATM withdrawal limit of 10,000 yuan ($1,450) remains unchanged, while the full-year limit of 100,000 yuan also remains effective, the Macau government says in a statement on its website.Casino stocks had pared losses in Hong Kong as analysts from Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. and Union Gaming Group LLC raised doubts about the accuracy of the report, which had said there will be a 50 percent cut on UnionPay ATM daily withdrawal limits in Macau, the world’s largest casinos hub.
