Netflix Inc.’s wide price swings underscore one of the main reasons fewer U.S. companies are going and staying public, according to Morgan Housel, a partner at the Collaborative Fund. On average, the video service’s stock price has moved more than 15 percent in either direction after each of its quarterly reports in the past seven years. Housel highlighted that volatility in a report this week, along with data from Wilshire Associates that showed the number of publicly traded U.S. companies fell about 50 percent in the past 20 years.
