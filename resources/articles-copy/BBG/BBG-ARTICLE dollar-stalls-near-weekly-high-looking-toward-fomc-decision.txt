The dollar is trading near its best level of the week as a rise in dollar-yen to a 10-month high is underpinned by still-robust U.S. Treasury yields and a stock market that refuses to say “enough.”The dollar resumed a weekly rally mid-morning Friday, gaining a slight impetus after the University of Michigan consumer confidence index rose to 98.0, an almost 2-year high, beating estimates for a more modest gain to 94.5. The dollar had already gained in the session but appeared to be flagging a little ahead of the sentiment data.The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 2.4766% in early afternoon trading, providing sufficient boost to lift the dollar to its best level of the session before a slight fade. For the week, the dollar is +0.5% as measured by the Bloomberg dollar index, approaching Monday’s high at 1,254.70.
