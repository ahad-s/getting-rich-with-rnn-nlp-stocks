Russia and several other non-OPEC nations pledged to curb oil production next year at a meeting in Vienna, joining forces with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to end a global glut that’s crashed oil prices and shaken energy-rich economies.The pact -- the first between the two sides in 15 years -- involves a reduction of 558,000 barrels a day from non-OPEC countries starting in January, Iraq Oil Minister Jabbar Al-Luaibi said on Saturday after the meeting ended.The agreement represents the strongest effort yet by oil-rich countries, from giants such as Saudi Arabia and Russia to tiny producers including Bolivia and Equatorial Guinea, to end a market share war that has shaken investors, hit energy companies and damaged economies.Oil prices have surged more than 15 percent since OPEC announced it will cut production for the first time in eight years, rising this week briefly above $55, more than double their January low. The price rise has propelled the share prices of energy groups from major companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp. to shale firms such as Continental Resources Inc."We managed to gather 25 countries from OPEC and non-OPEC with the idea of stabilizing the oil market and defending a fair price for our commodity," Venezuelan Energy Minister Eulogio del Pino said before the meeting.The pact comes two weeks after OPEC agreed to reduce its own production by 1.2 million barrels a day. It’s unclear whether the non-OPEC curbs agreed on Saturday include natural declines from countries such as Mexico, or consist entirely of genuine production cuts.Russia had already announced it plans to output by 300,000 barrels a day next year, down from a 30-year high last month of 11.2 million barrels a day. At the meeting, Mexico pledged to cut 100,000 barrels, Azerbaijan by 35,000 barrels and Oman by 40,000 barrels, a delegate said.The Iraqi oil minister said Mexico’s contributions would be made through “managed natural decline.”In a surprise move, Kazakhstan pledged a 20,000 barrels a day cut after coming under strong diplomatic pressure, delegates said, asking not to be identified before an official announcement. The Kazakh cut is particularly important because the International Energy Agency had expected the Asian nation to boost production in 2017 by 160,000 barrels a day after a giant oilfield started pumping.For analysis on how the deal may impact oil markets, click here.Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s de facto leader and the world’s top oil exporter, has long insisted that any reductions from the group should be accompanied by action from other suppliers. Even so, the deal agreed today may not reduce global stockpiles fast enough to radically alter market dynamics, especially if compliance is patchy."Emotionally, the market will likely rally," said Adam Ritchie, founder of AR Oil Consulting. "But beyond rebalancing supply and demand, we have excess inventory that is astronomic that will continue to keep a lid on prices.”OPEC production reached an all-time high of nearly 34.2 million barrels a day, well above the group’s target of 32.5 million barrels a day from January. Libya and Nigeria are exempted from the OPEC output cuts, while Iran has some room to boost its output.Russia and Oman will join OPEC members Algeria, Kuwait and Venezuela on the committee to oversee implementation on the accord, a delegate said.Riyadh this week informed customers in Europe and North America that it would supply less oil in January than December, reassuring Russia and others in the non-OPEC camp that the oil club is making good on its cuts. The United Arab Emirates said on Saturday that it will take similar action.“I’m sure you are following the news about actual notifications to the customers by a number of countries notably Saudi Arabia," Saudi Oil Minister Khalid Al-Falih said ahead of the meeting. "It should be a continuation of the positive spirit of cooperation and collaboration between OPEC and non-OPEC.”
