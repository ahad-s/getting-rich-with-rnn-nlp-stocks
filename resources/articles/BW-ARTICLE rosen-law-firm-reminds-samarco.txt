NO CLASS HAS YET BEEN CERTIFIED IN THE ABOVE ACTION. UNTIL A CLASS IS CERTIFIED, YOU ARE NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL UNLESS YOU RETAIN ONE. YOU MAY ALSO REMAIN AN ABSENT CLASS MEMBER AND DO NOTHING AT THIS POINT. YOU MAY RETAIN COUNSEL OF YOUR CHOICE.
According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Samarco’s Fundão tailings dam had longstanding systemic and structural defects; (2) Samarco ignored repeated, reliable warnings regarding the condition of the Fundão tailings dam while representing to investors that it had mitigated the risk of a catastrophic accident as much as possible through “a combination of risk management, careful evaluation, experience and knowledge,”; and (3) as a result, defendants’ statements about Samarco’s business, operations, and prospects were false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. On November 5, 2015, Samarco’s Fundão tailings dam burst. Subsequent investigations revealed that Samarco had disregarded safety concerns about the Fundão dam for years. When the truth about Samrco’s operations was revealed by the collapse of the Fundão dam and investigation into its causes, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.
