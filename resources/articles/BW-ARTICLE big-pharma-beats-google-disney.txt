“Congratulations to all companies that are creating positive work environments,” says Heidi Golledge, Chief Happiness Officer and Cofounder of CareerBliss.
“When most folks think of modern workplace happiness, they think of tech with unique office environments and casual dress codes with a long list of applicants eager to be a part of their fun and unique culture. However, in recent years a number of pharmaceutical and financial companies have gained momentum in creating happy work places for their employees. Factors such as career development programs and the opportunity for growth are propelling these companies forward, surpassing even Google and Disney in our CareerBliss happiness rankings,” continues Golledge.
What Makes Employees Happy?
According to employees in the CareerBliss 50 Happiest Companies list, it is employee career development programs and one’s relationship with senior leadership that are commonalities among the top companies for 2017.
One employee with Bristol-Myers Squibb states, "Bristol-Myers Squibb really cares about its employees and its patients. They have been able to navigate the rough waters of BIG pharma where other companies have gone under. The management team is supportive and committed to professional growth and development opportunities for their employees."
Another employee who works at Visa states, “I have found the company and particularly my manager to be honest and fair.”
