European stocks on Friday stayed on course for their biggest weekly rally since February amid supportive policies from the European Central Bank. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index added 0.1 percent at 8:21 a.m. in London.
Italyâ€™s FTSE MIB Index fell 0.4 percent, after its biggest three-day jump since July. Gains in its lenders boosted the benchmark earlier as the ECB expanded the parameters of its asset-buying program in a move that would help bank profitability. While Stoxx 600 lenders also halted a winning streak, they are still set for the biggest weekly advance since 2011.
