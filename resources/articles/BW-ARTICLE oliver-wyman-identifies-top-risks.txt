NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Oliver Wyman today identified the top three risks facing global businesses in 2017 as it launches its 6th annual Risk Journal.
The risks are:
“As we move into 2017, companies across all industries are facing significant risk on many fronts – most pressing are the three we identify in our annual Risk Journal. Each of these risks constitutes a serious threat on their own, but there is the potential for companies to be fighting problems on multiple fronts, making the year ahead even more challenging,” said Barrie Wilkinson, partner and co-head of EMEA finance & risk practice. “The main thing that companies can do to respond to these threats is to use the latest developments in technology to gain access to more timely risk management and business data and to ensure that they have the right in-house talent to unleash the power of this new technology and data.”
Now in its sixth year, the Oliver Wyman Risk Journal explores rapidly growing interconnected risks and offers insight on how companies can prepare for and navigate those risks. Articles included in this year’s Journal focus on a variety of issues the c-suite is facing including the impact of Brexit, digitization, compliance pressures and risk management trends.
