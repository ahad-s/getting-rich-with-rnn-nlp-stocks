"The only additional precaution that may be needed is certain preparations for a potential joint listing,” Mohammed Elkuwaiz of the Capital Markets Authority told reporters at a conference in Riyadh Tuesday. “Most of that work is less on the regulatory side and more on the operational side which is basically the exchange connecting with other exchanges.”
