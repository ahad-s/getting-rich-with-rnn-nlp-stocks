Dwortz takes the reigns at Helmsman Management Services from Debbie Michel, who was recently appointed executive vice president, National Insurance Casualty, Liberty Mutual. Under Michel’s leadership, Helmsman grew into a leading third party administrator. The operation experienced steady growth and flourished due to investments in distribution, claims and other resources that enable Helmsman to deliver consistently strong outcomes and service.
“Dwortz’ background and skills make him the ideal candidate to lead Helmsman,” notes Mike Fallon, president, National Insurance. “He has been with Liberty Mutual for 16 years, working in senior leadership roles in finance, underwriting, distribution and claims. Most recently, he led distribution for Commercial Insurance, where he managed our largest agent and broker relationships. He also ran Liberty Mutual’s Complex Claims Unit, focused on mass tort litigation. Dwortz’ experience will support even more focused investment and growth for Helmsman.”
