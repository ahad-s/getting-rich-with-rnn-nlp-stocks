ROCKVILLE, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Argan, Inc. (AGX) (the “Company”) today announced financial results for its third quarter ended October 31, 2016. Please read the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which the Company intends to file today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), and which can be retrieved from the SEC's website at www.sec.gov or from the Company's website at www.arganinc.com.

Highlights for the Quarter:
Third Quarter Results:
Consolidated revenues increased 54% to a record $175 million over the prior year quarter primarily due to GPS ramping up work on four large, gas-fired power plants and with the final completion of the two Panda power plants. Gross profit increased 39% to $36.6 million and gross margins decreased to 20.8% as compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to aforementioned increased revenues partially offset by lower margins at the non-Panda power plant projects and our two new subsidiaries, Atlantic Projects Company (APC) and The Roberts Company (TRC). The overall power industry services business continues to drive our financial results, reflecting 86% of consolidated revenues for the three months ended October 31, 2016. EBITDA attributable to our stockholders for the third quarter increased 48% to $27.0 million, or $1.73 per diluted share, from $18.2 million, or $1.21 per diluted share, for the prior year quarter. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen as of October 31, 2016, which has cash and short-term investments of $446.3 million, net liquidity of $209.4 million, and no debt.
Nine Months Ended Results:
For the nine months ended October 31, 2016, consolidated revenues increased 58% to a record $468 million over the prior year period primarily due to GPS ramping up work on four large, gas-fired power plants, the final completion of the two Panda power plants and the revenues from APC and TRC, which were acquired in May and December 2015, respectively. Gross profit increased 43% to $108.9 million as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to increased revenues, the Panda power plants achieving final completion and reaching a settlement of potential scheduled liquidated damages in the current period. EBITDA attributable to our stockholders for the nine months ended October 31, 2016 increased 58% to $79.3 million, or $5.12 per diluted share, from $50.1 million, or $3.34 per diluted share, for the prior year period.
Commenting on Argan’s third quarter results, Rainer Bosselmann, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “We were pleased to follow up our record second quarter with our next best quarter in Company history. These sustained results could not have been achieved without the operational excellence of our employees. Their dedication to finish out projects while simultaneously ramping up on four large, gas-fired plants allowed us to post strong current quarter results and to pay our largest dividend to date - $1.00 per share. Even though we did not add any major projects to our backlog over the last several quarters, it remains over $1.1 billion and we expect continued growth in our revenues the rest of this year and into the next.”
