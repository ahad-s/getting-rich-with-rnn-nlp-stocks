SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Along with the American Red Cross and the Unity Council, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) today announced plans to bring relief to victims of this past weekend’s Oakland warehouse fire.
In support of the local Oakland community, PG&E is donating $30,000 in total to the American Red Cross Disaster Relief and the Unity Council. The donations will be used to provide relief and support those impacted by the fire.
“By partnering with the American Red Cross and the Unity Council, we hope that we can bring at least a small measure of comfort and help to those affected by this horrifying tragedy. PG&E is humbled to partner with these organizations which so often provide the helping hand, warm meal and open heart to those facing disaster. Our hearts go out to the victims and their families and the Oakland community as a whole,” said Helen Burt, senior vice president, External Affairs and Public Policy for PG&E.
PG&E’s donation will support the Unity Council’s activation of the Senior Center at the Fruitvale-San Antonio Transit Village to provide a community gathering space for local residents, artists and businesses. PG&E’s donation to American Red Cross Disaster Relief is used to help people and communities prepare for, respond to and recover from disasters big and small.
"PG&E and the American Red Cross continue their long standing partnership to assist people impacted by disasters across Northern California. The tragic fire in Oakland reminds us of the importance of providing a safety net for people impacted by disasters and we will continue to work together to educate the community about fire safety and disaster preparedness moving forward," said Trevor Riggen, Regional Chief Executive Officer, American Red Cross of the Bay Area.
“We have deep connections to artists in this community and want to be as supportive as possible to them through this grieving process. One way we can do that is by providing safe, clean, and warm spaces for our community to gather in. We feel that right now this is the best way for us to follow the leadership of the Mayor’s Office, the county, and the Red Cross in their recovery efforts,” said Chris Iglesias, Chief Executive Officer, the Unity Council.
