Japan revised third-quarter economic growth to an annualized 1.3 percent, compared with a preliminary reading that showed 2.2 percent expansion. The revision was driven by drops in capital spending and in private inventories, which both dragged down growth.
The official size of Japan’s economy expanded as the nation revamped how it calculates gross domestic product, classifying research and development differently.
The new methodology will bring Prime Minister Shinzo Abe a bit closer to his goal of expanding GDP to 600 trillion yen, but it won’t fix the problems in Japan’s economy, which has swung between modest growth and contraction in recent quarters. Domestic consumption and wage growth remain tepid. Exports, though, are showing signs of a recovery, and these companies should receive a boost from the yen’s decline following President-elect Donald Trump’s win last month.
