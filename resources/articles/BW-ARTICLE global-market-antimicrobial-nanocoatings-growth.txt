DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "The Global Market for Antimicrobial Nanocoatings" report to their offering.
The global antimicrobial nano-coatings market continues to grow in areas such as medical devices, urinary catheters and stainless steel coatings. New legislation and growing microbial resistance against metal ions, antibiotics and the development of resistant strains has resulted in coating manufacturers seeking alternatives to traditional antimicrobial coatings. The development of antimicrobial agents with low toxicity and ability to inhibit microbial contamination is a key issue in the development of new coatings for healthcare, packaging and food and pharmaceutical production. The ability of nanoparticles to meet these has led to their increased use in these and numerous other markets such as consumer electronics, textiles, water filtration and household care.
A wide variety of organic or inorganic biocides are available commercially and these demonstrate a wide variety of biocidal and biostatic mechanisms. Nanoparticles of different materials have demonstrated enhanced antimicrobial activity. This report looks at improvements over existing antimicrobial agents offered by nanosilver, titanium dioxide nanoparticles, zinc oxide nanoparticles, iron oxide nanoparticles, nanocellulose, copper nanoparticles, carbon nanomaterials and nano chitosan.
