According to ClimateMaster and OSU’s Building and Environmental Research Group, the larger units will be used as dedicated conditioning equipment for a brand-new heat exchanger test facility and to upgrade the capacity of the school’s psychrometric chambers. “The smaller units will be converted into demonstration units in a new undergraduate laboratory utilizing ground source loop technology and used for research projects,” remarked Dr. Craig Bradshaw of OSU.
Units were also donated to Purdue University’s Center for High Performance Buildings. According to Dr. Jim Braun at Purdue, these units would be used to provide heat input and heat rejection for experimental setups at the Center’s Thermal Systems Laboratory.
ClimateMaster also donated units to Auburn University, University of Maryland and University of Central Oklahoma.
