CHICAGO & SAO PAULO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Fitch Ratings says Localiza Rent a Car S.A.'s (Localiza) ratings will not be affected by its acquisition of Car Rental Systems do Brasil Locacao de Veiculos Ltda. (Hertz Brazil) for BRL337 million. The transaction is expected to close by mid first half of 2017, and it is subject to approval from CADE (Brazilian's Antitrust authority).
Fitch views the transaction as positive from a strategic perspective as Localiza will benefit from a larger client base and new demand from foreign passengers in Brazil. Access to new technologies is another key aspect of the transaction. From a financial perspective the impact will be minimal. Hertz Brazil's fleet of 9,200 cars is relatively small compared to Localiza's fleet of 122,334 vehicles as of Sept. 30, 2016.
As part of the transaction, Localiza and Hertz Corp will establish a strategic alliance and a global and long-term agreement through brand cooperation, which includes, among other, the use of the combined brand 'Localiza Hertz' in Brazil and the use by Hertz of 'Localiza' brand in the main airports in USA and Europe which have significant flow of Brazilian clients; and a Referral Agreement that establishes the rules for the exchange of inbound and outbound reservations between Localiza and Hertz Corp. The alliance will also include the exchange of know-how and executives between the two companies.
Localiza has a track record of strong credit metrics that provides enough rating headroom to support an acquisition of this size. From 2012 through the LTM ended Sept. 30, 2016, Localiza's FFO Adjusted Leverage averaged 1.2x, while its net adjusted debt/EBITDAR ratio averaged 2.0x. On pro forma basis per Fitch's calculation, Localiza FFO Net Adjusted Leverage would climb to 1.1x from 0.9x, while its net adjusted debt/EBITDAR ratio would increase to 2.5x from 2.3x.
On Sept. 30, 2016, Localiza had total adjusted debt of BRL3.7 billion and cash of BRL1.2 billion. The company shows a quite strong debt amortization schedule, with cash sufficient to cover all debt coming due until mid-2019.
Fitch currently rates Localiza as follows:
Localiza Rent a Car S.A.'s (Localiza):
--Long-Term Foreign-Currency (FC) IDR 'BB+';
--Long-Term Local-Currency IDR 'BBB';
--Long-term National Scale Rating 'AAA(bra)';
--Unsecured sixth, seventh, ninth, 10th, 11th debenture issuance 'AAA(bra)'.
The Rating Outlook for Localiza's Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR is Negative due to Brazil's 'BB+' Country Ceiling rating, which constrains the rating and the Outlook of the sovereign's 'BB' Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR. Localiza's operations are essentially in Brazil. The company does not have assets or substantial amounts of cash held abroad.
The Rating Outlooks for Localiza's Local-Currency IDR and its National Scale Rating are Stable.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.

A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security.

Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.
