The new concept store is one of a few new retail formats that PetSmart is testing. The store features a heavy emphasis on pet services including grooming and Doggie Day Camp services. The new retail design has a unique, modern aesthetic with approximately 6,000 square feet of space – a smaller footprint than PetSmart’s typical stores, which average between 18,000-20,000 square feet. Also unique to PetSmart, the largest pet specialty retailer, is this new concept store’s gigantic chandelier made of tennis balls!
Store Details Include:
Modern Pet-Lifestyle Design – the first thing customers will see when they walk in the door of the PetSmart Pet Spa® is an overall modern aesthetic and a circular “concierge” desk for assisting pet parents with their Doggie Day Camp and grooming salon appointments.
Self-Service Dog Wash – self-service dog wash bays give pet parents an easy solution to bathe and bond with their pet. The washing stations feature wall-mounted washing and drying equipment and an array of complimentary shampoos and conditioners that address a range of needs from de-shedding to skin sensitivities.
Pinnacle Pet Nutrition Shop – this store features an expanded collection of pet food products featuring high-protein, natural, grain-free, minimally processed and raw pet food. These pet food types are the fastest growing in the overall pet food category and include brands such as Only Natural Pet®, a natural pet line that is protein-first, sustainably produced, American-manufactured pet food, as well as a line of supplements and other natural pet solutions. PetSmart is the exclusive national retailer for this natural pet brand.
Coffee Bar – a coffee bar area provides complimentary coffee for pet parents to enjoy while pets receive grooming services, or after a self-service dog wash.
*All grand opening giveaways available while supplies last.
