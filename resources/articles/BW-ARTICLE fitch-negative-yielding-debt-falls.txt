NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
The decline in outstanding negative-yielding sovereign debt has accelerated following the recent US election and global bond market sell-off, with the total falling to $9.3 trillion as of Nov. 28, according to Fitch Ratings.
Beyond the immediate losses from decreasing bond prices, the sharp decrease in the stock of negative-yielding debt could be positive for institutional bond investors putting new money to work. If sustained, it could also help to arrest the trend of falling investment income due to record low and declining sovereign yields over the past several years.
Yields on long-term debt in major developed countries, the type that many insurance companies and pension funds own, rose sharply in November. Losses over the past month have been particularly severe for investors in long-maturity, low-coupon debt, which is subject to large price swings.
Rising yields have driven down the amount of negative-yielding debt outstanding, with the total falling more than $1 trillion in less than a month. Fitch calculates the latest total at $9.3 trillion as of Nov. 28, down from $10.4 trillion on Nov. 1 and $11.7 trillion at the end of 1H16. Only $1.0 trillion in debt with seven or more years to remaining maturity carried a negative yield, compared to $1.5 trillion on Nov. 1, and $2.6 trillion as of June 27, as seen in the chart below.
Japan still has more negative-yielding debt outstanding than all of Europe, but the total declined dramatically in recent weeks. The amount of debt with yields below zero in Japan decreased to $6.1 trillion from $6.9 trillion on Nov. 1 and $7.9 trillion on June 27.
For the first time since March, yields on the 10-year Japanese bond are above zero. Yields on the short end of the curve have also increased in Japan, but remain negative as the Bank of Japan recently announced their plan to buy unlimited amounts of one- to five-year sovereign debt issues to help control the yield curve.
In Europe, the amount of negative-yielding debt outstanding has decreased in every country since Nov. 1. There is $3.2 trillion in sub-zero-yielding sovereign debt in the continent, down about $0.4 trillion since the beginning of the month, and $0.6 trillion from June 27.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third-party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.

A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security.

Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.
