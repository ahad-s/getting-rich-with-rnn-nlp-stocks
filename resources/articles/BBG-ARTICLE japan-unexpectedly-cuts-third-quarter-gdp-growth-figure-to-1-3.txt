Japan unexpectedly cut its reading of third-quarter economic growth to an annualized 1.3 percent, from a preliminary estimate of 2.2 percent expansion. The revision was driven by drops in business spending and in private inventories.Meanwhile, the government’s projection for the overall size of the economy rose, thanks to changes in the way gross domestic product is calculated.The new methodology will bring Prime Minister Shinzo Abe a bit closer to his goal of expanding GDP to 600 trillion yen, but it won’t fix the problems in Japan’s economy, which has swung between modest growth and contraction in recent quarters. Domestic consumption and wage growth remain tepid. Exports, though, are showing signs of a recovery, and these companies should receive a boost from the yen’s decline following President-elect Donald Trump’s win last month.
