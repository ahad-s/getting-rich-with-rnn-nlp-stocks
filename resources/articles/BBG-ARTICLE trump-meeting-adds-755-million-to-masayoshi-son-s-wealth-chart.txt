Masayoshi Son’s meeting with Donald Trump on Tuesday was well-timed and well worth it. News of the encounter, where the Japanese billionaire told the President-elect he’d invest $50 billion in U.S. startups and new companies, sent shares in Son’s SoftBank Group Corp. to a 15-month high on Wednesday, adding $755 million to his fortune. He’s Japan’s second-richest person with a $12 billion fortune, $6.2 billion behind Fast Retailing Co.’s Tadashi Yanai, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
