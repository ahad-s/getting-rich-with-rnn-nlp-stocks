CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Fitch Ratings has affirmed all seven rated classes of Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.'s COMM 2014-CCRE14 commercial mortgage pass-through certificates. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this release.
KEY RATING DRIVERS
The affirmations are based on overall stable performance since issuance. As of the November 2016 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 2.4% to $1.35 billion from $1.38 billion at issuance. Three loans (6.4% of the pool) are currently on the servicer watchlist, but two of the loans (4.8%) have issues related to minor deferred maintenance or an occupancy decrease associated with seasonality and are not considered Fitch Loans of Concern. Fitch's Loans of Concern consist of three (1.7%) defaulted and specially serviced loans located in the Bakken Shale region, one (1.5%) of the watchlist loans, and one loan (2%) in the top 15 loans with an occupancy issue. Five loans (3.3%) are fully defeased.
Stable Overall Performance: Based on full-year 2015 financial statements, the pool's overall net operating income for those reporting financials has increased 3.1% since last year's rating action and 6.6% since issuance. The pool's Fitch stressed DSCR and LTV is 1.28x and 92.7% which is an improvement from the issuance metrics of 1.22x and 94.4%, respectively.
Loans of Concern: The largest Loan of Concern is the McKinley Mall, the 14th largest loan in the pool (2% of pool). The non-collateral anchor, Macy's, vacated its two spaces at the mall during the first half of 2016. Both parcels were purchased by a local developer, Benderson Development, in September 2016. Although the new owner has plans to redevelop and backfill the spaces, no decisions or prospects have been announced at this time. The collateral has exhibited stable performance with the year-end 2015 servicer-reported occupancy and debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) at 96% and 1.72x (times) compared to 97% and 1.80x at issuance, respectively. Fitch requested but did not receive an updated sales report from the master servicer. Fitch applied an additional stress to the property's cashflow and cap rate to reflect the increased vacancy for the whole property and the possibility of additional inline tenant vacancies as a result of losing a major anchor tenant.
The second largest Fitch Loan of Concern (1.5%) is secured by 16530 Ventura Boulevard, a 157,414 square foot (ft) suburban office building located in Encino, CA. The subject's occupancy and DSCR was a 87% and 1.32x as of year-end 2015 compared to 85% and 1.45x at issuance, respectively. According to servicer commentary, the building's cashflow has decreased as leases for 48% of the net rentable area expires during the next 12 months. Fitch will continue to monitor the loan as the sponsor updates the servicer on the leasing activity during the first half of the 2017.
Energy/North Dakota Exposure: Three loans (1.7% of the pool), each collateralized by multifamily properties located in the Bakken shale region of North Dakota, are in special servicing. The properties are located in Williston, Tioga, and Stanley, ND and are categorized as 60 or 90 days delinquent. Fitch assumed significant losses on these assets.
High Multifamily/Low Lodging and Retail Exposure: The second largest property type concentration is multifamily (21.3%), which is viewed favorably in Fitch analysis. Retail is relatively low at 13.1%, and hotel is lower than comparable 2012 transactions at 10.1%.
Interest-Only Loans: The pool amortizes by approximately 10.3% from aggregate cutoff balance to aggregate maturity balance. The pool includes four interest-only (IO) loans (27.7%) and 17 partial IO loans (34.1%).
Significant Additional Debt: The pool contains seven loans with pari passu debt (44.5%), six loans with subordinate financing (33%), and 14 loans allowing future subordinate debt (22.4%). Of the seven loans with pari passu debt, COMM 2014 CCRE14 PSA will govern the servicing of four loans (Google and Amazon Office Portfolio, 60 Hudson Street, 625 Madison Avenue, and McKinley Mall).
Pool Concentration: The 10 largest loans represent approximately 56.4% of the total pool balance. This is in line with the 2013 average of 54.5%.
RATING SENSITIVITIES
The Rating Outlooks on all classes remain Stable. Fitch does not foresee negative ratings migration until a material economic or asset-level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio-level metrics.

Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.
The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.
