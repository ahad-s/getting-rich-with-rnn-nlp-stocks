DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Crude Sulfate Turpentine Market by Type (Alpha Pinene, Beta Pinene, Delta 3 Carene, Camphene, Limonene), Application (Aromatic Chemicals, Adhesives, Paints and printing inks, Camphor), and Region - Global Forecast to 2022" report to their offering.
The crude sulfate turpentine market is valued at USD 213.87 million in 2015 , is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.10%, to reach USD 279.5 million by 2022
The market is primarily driven by factors such as increasing usage of fragrance ingredients that include crude sulfate turpentine derivatives. Asia-Pacific is projected to be the fastest growing region due to the high paper production that further supports the refining companies to obtain black liquor at relatively low prices and in turn derive crude sulfate derivatives.
One of the major restraints in the growth of the crude sulfate turpentine market is the high dependence for black liquor on the paper industry as well as the lack of control on the quality of the crude sulfate turpentine manufactured by paper manufacturers.
On the basis of type, the crude sulfate turpentine market was led by the alpha-pinene segment, followed by beta-pinene and delta-3-carene. Alpha pinene is increasingly used globally in various applications such as aromatic chemicals, adhesives, paints and printing inks, and camphor among others. Alpha-pinene is consumed on a large scale across regions due to its bulk production and broad applicability.
The camphor segment dominates the crude sulfate turpentine market due to the large-scale availability of camphor, which in turn drives the demand for the crude sulfate derivatives across the globe. The camphor application segment is projected to witness high growth owing to the high demand in the European and RoW regions.
