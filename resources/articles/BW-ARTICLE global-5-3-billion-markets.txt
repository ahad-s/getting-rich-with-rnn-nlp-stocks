DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Global Markets for Nanocomposites, Nanoparticles, Nanoclays, and Nanotubes" report to their offering.
The global nanocomposite market, in value terms, should reach $5.3 billion by 2021 from $1.6 billion in 2016 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 26.7%, from 2016 to 2021.
The report addresses the global market for nanocomposites. Nanocomposites are a class of composites that have at least one component with nanoscale dimensions or structural features. This study, however, excludes certain materials (e.g., rubber, to which carbon black nanoparticles have been added) that technically fit the definition of nanocomposites but have been in commercial use for decades.
This report provides:
- An overview of the global market for nanocomposites, nanoparticles, nanoclays, and nanotubes.
- Analyses of global market trends, with data from 2015, 2016, and projections of compound annual growth rates (CAGRs) through 2021.
- Details on nanocomposites that are in commercial use or under development, associated technologies, and relevant applications.
- Information on the industry's structure as well as about factors that will influence the long-term development of these markets.
- Breakdowns of the market by share.
