NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. is investigating potential claims on behalf of OCI Partners LP (OCIP) unitholders relating to the proposed going private transaction of the company by OCI N.V.
Under the terms of the proposed transaction, OCI Partners unitholders would receive 0.52 OCI N.V. units for each OCI Partners common unit they own, an implied value of $7.80 per unit. The proposed offer price is below the companyâ€™s 52-week high of $8.10 per unit and substantially below the median analyst price target of $11.40 per unit.
The investigation concerns whether the proposed offer price inadequately values OCI Partners common units, such that OCI Partners unitholders would not receive maximum value for their units.
If you hold OCI Partners common units, have information or would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters please contact J. Brandon Walker, Esq. by email at investigations@bespc.com, or telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form. There is no cost or obligation to you.
