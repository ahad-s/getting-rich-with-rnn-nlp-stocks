DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "GFRP Composites Market By Resin Type, Manufacturing Process, Application and By Region - Global Forecast To 2026" report to their offering.
The global Glass Fiber Reinforced Plastics GFRP composites market is projected to reach USD 83.63 billion by 2026, at a CAGR of 6.61% from 2016 to 2026.
The major driver stimulating the GFRP composites market is the high demand from the wing energy application, as these are non-corrosive and lightweight. Due to the corrosion resistance properties, GFRP composites have helped the growth of the wind industry, as GFRP composites wind turbines can operate in the toughest climatic environments. The difficulty of recycling GFRP composites is a major restraint, restricting its use in various applications and hindering the growth of the global GFRP composites market.
The injection molding process has many processing advantages, including very fast cycle time, low labor costs, low scrap rate, and low mold-clamping pressure. It is widely applicable in GFRP composite applications such as automotive and electrical & electronics for the production of bumpers for vehicles, panels for electrical equipment, enclosures for medical devices, and others. These are the key applications of GFRP composites, thus driving the use of the injection molding process to manufacture various GFRP composite components.
The Asia-Pacific region is expected to be the fastest-growing market for GFRP composites during the next five years. The market in this region is driven by the increasing consumption of GFRP composites in various industries such as wind energy, construction, electrical & electronics, and transportation. China leads the market in the Asia-Pacific region. The wind energy industry in China witnessed the highest number of wind energy installations in 2015, and added new capacity of 30.8 GW.
