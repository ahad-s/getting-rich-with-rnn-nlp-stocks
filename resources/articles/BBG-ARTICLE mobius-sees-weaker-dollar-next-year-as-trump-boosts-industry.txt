Mark Mobius on U.S. Dollar, Emerging Markets and OilMark Mobius thinks that the dollar may be going down, not up.The greenback is set to weaken as the U.S. government under Donald Trump increases spending on defense and infrastructure, Mobius, the executive chairman of Templeton Emerging Markets Group, said Wednesday. A lower-valued currency, coupled with faster U.S. economic growth, will benefit the rest of the world, especially emerging markets, he said.“Don’t be surprised if the U.S. dollar gets weak, and not stronger,” Mobius said at the Bloomberg Markets Most Influential summit in Abu Dhabi. “If Trump is going to make America industry competitive, he needs a weak dollar.”Goldman Sachs Group Inc. President Gary Cohn has warned that a strengthening dollar poses a growing threat to U.S. manufacturers by making imported products more competitive. The currency has surged to the highest in more than a decade since Trump’s election victory last month on speculation his proposals to increase spending and cut taxes will fuel economic growth and prompt the Federal Reserve to boost interest rates.
