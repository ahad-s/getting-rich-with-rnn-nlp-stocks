With the WristView, a powerful and compact MRI, patients with hand and wrist complaints can be quickly diagnosed in a patient-friendly and comfortable manner. The advantages include:
Annually, approximately 2 million Dutch citizens suffer from injuries to their hand or wrist. On average, people experience injuries to their hand or wrist twice in their lifetime, and a non-traumatic disorder at least once in their lifetime. These injuries can lead to absenteeism and thus represent a considerable cost to society. The direct and indirect costs due to hand and wrist complications are estimated at €600 million annually in the Netherlands alone. Costs of osteoarthritis and other degenerative diseases add to this tremendous sum.
The WristView MRI system is a game changer in healthcare management, enabling the transition from “fee for service” models of healthcare delivery, to “value added” care models, such as enhanced patient monitoring and rehabilitation practices.
Commenting on the purchase of Europe’s first WristView system, Dr. Monika Ritt-Fischer, director of The Hand Clinic says: “The placement of this compact MRI is a logical step in our long term goal of remaining a leader in the field of hand and wrist treatment. In collaboration with Aspect Imaging, in the short term, we’re aiming to also offer MRI for pediatric patients where claustrophobia is a concern. Up until now this couldn’t be done. With specialists from Amsterdam-based university medical centers, we’re teaming-up to explore the full potential of this new technology, enabling us to offer optimal treatment for our patients with hand and wrist complaints.”
