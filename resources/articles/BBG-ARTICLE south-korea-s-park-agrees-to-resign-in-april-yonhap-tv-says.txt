South Korea's Park Agrees to Resign in April: Yonhap TVSouth Korean President Park Geun-hye remains willing to step down in April over an influence-peddling scandal that has shaken Asia’s fourth-biggest economy, ruling party floor leader Chung Jin-suk said in televised remarks.Park met Tuesday with Saenuri Party lawmakers after opposition parliamentarians said they might have enough votes to impeach her, with a ballot set for Friday. If parliament were to impeach her, Park would be suspended from power unless the move was rejected by the constitutional court. If she were instead to resign, a presidential election would be held 60 days after she stepped down.Park’s office has yet to confirm the nature of the party discussions, though her senior political adviser Hur Won-je said Monday she would accept a party proposal that she step down at the end of April. The president is also ready to face the result of any impeachment vote, Chung said.Park’s resignation offer may be too late to halt momentum for her impeachment. A faction of her party agreed Sunday to support the parliamentary motion regardless of whether she resigns, Chang Je-won, a Saenuri lawmaker, said on Facebook. The 29 lawmakers made their decision after witnessing another large protest against Park on Saturday.Read more: An explainer on the scandalChang’s faction would provide the opposition with just enough votes to reach the threshold of 200 required to pass the impeachment motion in the 300-seat National Assembly.
