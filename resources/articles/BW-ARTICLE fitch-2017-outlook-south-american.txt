NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: 2017 Outlook: South American Banks (Exc. Brazil) (Mixed Degrees of Financial Flexibility Amid a Challenging Environment)
https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/890986
Fitch Ratings has published a 2017 Outlook for South American Banks (excluding Brazil), highlighting mixed degrees of robustness against global market conditions.
South American banks have generally demonstrated solid loan quality ratios since the commodities price shock of 2014, despite sluggish economic growth, currency volatility and narrower margins. Fitch expects loan quality indicators to be pressured mildly as loans season through the less favourable growth cycle. In Venezuela and Argentina, inflation-induced credit growth should continue to support near-term loan quality ratios.
Sector outlooks diverge, however, with respect to performance and capitalization. Peruvian and Chilean banks stand out for their resilient financial metrics, a trend Fitch expects to continue in 2017. Colombian banks, however, will continue to adapt to tighter interest margins and pressured capital stemming from a sharp local currency depreciation and changes in accounting standards.
With the exception of Ecuador and Venezuela, bank regulation is progressing toward alignment with Basel III capital rules, albeit with local particularities and at different paces. These rules are phasing in higher quality capital requirements, including loss absorbing secondary capital and international standards for liquidity coverage.
With the exception of Venezuela (where Fitch sees no near term stabilization in operating conditions), Fitch expects banks in the region to continue holding up well against global headwinds. Banks have largely adjusted to currency and commodity price volatility and major electoral and climate downside risks failed to materialize. As a result, sector outlooks could eventually improve in line with recovering credit growth, improved financial performance, and in Colombia, recovered solvency indicators.

Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.
The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.
