Children can also decorate a holiday ornament and take home a free coloring book.
The new store features nearly 10,000 square feet of space, providing pet parents with a broad range of competitively priced pet food and a comprehensive line of pet products. The new store also offers useful services such as pet training and adoption services, as well as a full-service grooming salon where dogs and cats receive hands-on care from academy-trained, safety-certified stylists dedicated to making pets look and feel their best.**
PetSmart, The Adopt Spot™
PetSmart, The Adopt Spot, is where people save pets and pets save people. Since its founding in 1987, PetSmart recognized the pet homelessness problem and made the decision to never sell dogs or cats. To help end pet homelessness and save lives, PetSmart joins PetSmart Charities®, PetSmart Charities™ of Canada and nearly 3,000 local animal welfare organizations across North America on a range of powerful adoption events in PetSmart stores.
PetSmart is a leader in ending pet homelessness through in-store adoptions that happen every day in its stores, and through National Adoption Weekends, held four times a year, where more than 20,000 pets find forever homes in a single weekend. Each year, millions of pets enter shelters across North America and some 3 million healthy, adoptable pets are euthanized.
Every PetSmart store, including this store in Walnut Creek, builds long-lasting relationships with local animal welfare organizations to utilize its stores as adoption centers. PetSmart and its adoption partners have reached a significant milestone – 7 million pets adopted since 1994! For every 30 seconds a PetSmart store is open a pet’s life is saved, totaling about 1,400 lives saved every day.
