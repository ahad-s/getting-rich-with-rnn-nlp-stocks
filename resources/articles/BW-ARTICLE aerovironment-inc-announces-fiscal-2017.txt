MONROVIA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
AeroVironment, Inc. (AVAV) today reported financial results for its second quarter ended October 29, 2016.
“Strong order flow in the second quarter increased funded backlog by 60 percent, sequentially, to $119.6 million, supporting our full year objectives,” said Wahid Nawabi, AeroVironment chief executive officer. “Second quarter results are in-line with our previously stated forecast and we have made significant progress executing against our strategic objectives.”
"Our business remains strong and we expect robust demand for small unmanned aircraft systems and support services from international customers across the globe. Our family of Tactical Missile Systems continues to provide uniquely valuable force protection capabilities to United States troops in a growing number of ways. Leveraging our demonstrated and successful UAS expertise into commercial markets, which represents a large opportunity for our business, remains an important priority for us. In November we unveiled our comprehensive commercial information solution, consisting of the breakthrough Quantix drone, our Decision Support System software platform and turnkey flight services. As we move into the second half of fiscal 2017, we anticipate an increase in work across our portfolio and remain committed to achieving our financial and strategic objectives and delivering value to our shareholders,” Mr. Nawabi added.
FISCAL 2017 SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 was $50.1 million, a decrease from second quarter fiscal 2016 revenue of $64.7 million. The decrease in revenue resulted from a decrease in sales in our Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) segment of $15.8 million, partially offset by an increase in sales in our Efficient Energy Systems (EES) segment of $1.1 million.
Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 was $17.4 million, a decrease from second quarter fiscal 2016 gross margin of $31.5 million. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to a decrease in product margin of $14.5 million, partially offset by an increase in service margin of $0.4 million. As a percentage of revenue, gross margin decreased from 49% to 35%. The decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily due to the reserve reversal of $3.5 million for the settlement of prior year government incurred cost audits recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, a decrease in product sales volume, which resulted in an increase in the per unit fixed manufacturing and engineering overhead support cost and an increase sustaining engineering activities in support of our existing products of $1.3 million.
Loss from operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 was $4.5 million compared to second quarter fiscal 2016 income from operations of $6.9 million. The decrease in the year over year income from operations was a result of a decrease in gross margin of $14.1 million, partially offset by a decrease in research and development (R&D) expense of $1.4 million and a decrease in selling, general and administrative (SGA) expense of $1.3 million.
Other income, net, for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 was $0.3 million compared to other income, net of $0.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2016.
Benefit for income taxes for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 was $48,000 compared to provision for income taxes of $2.6 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. The decrease in provision for income taxes was primarily due to a decrease in income before income taxes, an increase in tax credits as a result of federal legislation reinstating the federal research and development tax credit during the three months ended January 30, 2016 and the reversal of a reserve for uncertain tax positions due to the settlement of prior fiscal year audits recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
Net loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 was $4.2 million compared to net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 of $4.4 million.
Loss per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 was $0.18 compared to earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 of $0.19.
FISCAL 2017 YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS
Revenue for the first six months of fiscal 2017 was $86.3 million, a decrease from the first six months’ fiscal 2016 revenue of $111.8 million. The decrease in revenue resulted from a decrease in sales in our UAS segment of $25.4 million. Sales in our EES segment were unchanged at $15.0 million during the first six months of fiscal 2017 and 2016.
Gross margin for the first six months of fiscal 2017 was $24.1 million, a decrease of 49% from the first six months’ fiscal 2016 gross margin of $47.6 million. The decrease in gross margin was due to a decrease in product margin of $23.9 million, partially offset by an increase in service margin of $0.4 million. As a percentage of revenue, gross margin decreased to 28% from 43%. The decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily due to the reserve reversal of $3.5 million for the settlement of prior year government incurred cost audits recorded in the first six months of fiscal 2016, an increase in sustaining engineering activities in support of our existing products of $2.7 million and an increase in warranty related costs of $1.7 million related to certain small UAS delivered in prior periods.
Loss from operations for the first six months of fiscal 2017 was $20.1 million compared to loss from operations for the first six months of fiscal 2016 of $2.2 million. The increase in loss from operations was a result of a decrease in gross margin of $23.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in SG&A expense of $2.9 million and a decrease in R&D expense of $2.6 million.
Other income, net, for the first six months of fiscal 2017 was $0.3 million compared to other expense, net, for the first six months of fiscal 2016 of $2.1 million. The decrease in expense was primarily due to the recording of an other-than-temporary impairment loss of $2.2 million on our CybAero equity securities during the first six months of fiscal 2016. The CybAero equity securities were sold during the second quarter of fiscal 2016.
Benefit for income taxes for the first six months of fiscal 2017 was $3.9 million compared to $1.7 million for the first six months of fiscal 2016. The increase in benefit for income taxes was primarily due to an increase in loss before income taxes, partially offset by an increase in tax credits as a result of federal legislation reinstating the federal research and development tax credit during the three months ended January 30, 2016 and the reversal of a reserve for uncertain tax positions due to the settlement of prior fiscal year audits recorded in the first six months of fiscal 2017.
Net loss for the first six months of fiscal 2017 was $15.8 million compared to net loss for the first six months of fiscal 2016 of $2.6 million.
Loss per share for the first six months of fiscal 2017 was $0.69 compared to loss per share for the first six months of fiscal 2016 of $0.11. Loss per share for the first six months of fiscal 2016 increased by $0.06 due to both the impairment loss and loss on sale of our CybAero equity securities.
BACKLOG
As of October 29, 2016, funded backlog (unfilled firm orders for which funding is currently appropriated to us under a customer contract) was $119.6 million compared to $65.8 million as of April 30, 2016.
