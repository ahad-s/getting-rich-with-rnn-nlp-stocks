LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Top 100 UK law firm Lewis Silkin LLP has today launched its evolved business strategy, showcased through a significantly enhanced website and revamped brand identity.
Known as a market leader in the provision of employment, immigration and reward advice, and in providing legal services to businesses that make up the creative economy, Lewis Silkin offers market-leading insight and experience across eight core sectors; including Advertising & Marketing; Manufacturing & Engineering; Media & Entertainment; Retail, Fashion & Hospitality; Sports Business; Technology; Financial Services; and Professional Services.
The firm’s new strategy focuses on enhancing this offering through a significant organisational restructure, development of legal expertise and advice in these areas and further investment in its suite of complementary and related non-legal business services.
The launch of the new site marks the culmination of this 18-month initiative and reflects the firm’s unique culture, value proposition and reputation as innovative, collaborative and specialist.
While unifying the firm under a core identity, both website and brand have been designed to support and empower the firm’s two market-leading business divisions focused on the firm’s core markets: Creators, Makers & Innovators - supporting creative, innovative and brand-focused businesses; and Employment, Immigration & Reward - supporting senior executives, senior human resource professionals and employment lawyers within major UK and international businesses.
