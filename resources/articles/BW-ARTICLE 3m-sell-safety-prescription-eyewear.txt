ST. PAUL, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
3M announced today that it has entered into an agreement to sell its safety prescription eyewear business to HOYA Vision Care, a global leader in the eyeglass lens industry. The safety prescription eyewear business is part of 3M’s Personal Safety Division, which is in the Safety & Graphics Business. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
The business, with more than 90 years as an industry leader in safety prescription eyewear in North America, provides a comprehensive line of frames, prescription lenses, and premium coating options in a custom-made solution. 3M’s safety prescription eyewear business has annual global sales of approximately $45 million.
