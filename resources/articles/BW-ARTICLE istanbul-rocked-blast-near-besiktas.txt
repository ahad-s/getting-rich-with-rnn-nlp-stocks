A pair of explosions near Vodafone Arena in central Istanbul on Saturday night appeared to target riot police stationed there after a soccer match, according to local media.
The blasts occurred around 10:30 p.m., more than an hour after the end of the match between Besiktas, the home team, and Bursaspor at the stadium, which has a capacity of over 40,000. About 20 people were injured, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said immediately after the blasts. He later declined to give any further details on casualties.
The blasts could be heard across the city of about 15 million people, Turkeyâ€™s largest and most important both commercially and historically.
Video footage showed the stadium, which overlooks the Bosphorus Strait, surrounded by police and at least 10 ambulances after the explosions. One of the blasts appears to have been a suicide bomber in Macka Park, which is across the street from the stadium, Soylu said.
