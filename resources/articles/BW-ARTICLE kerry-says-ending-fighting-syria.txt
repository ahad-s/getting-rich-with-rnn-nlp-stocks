Ending the fighting in Aleppo and renewing negotiations on a political settlement in Syria depends on “big magnanimous” gestures from Russia, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said after a meeting of foreign ministers in Paris.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said the Syrian opposition is ready to go back to negotiations without conditions, though he didn’t detail which divided rebel groups would be represented.
Kerry said Russian and U.S. teams were meeting in Geneva today to work out details on how surrounded rebel groups may be allowed to leave Aleppo.
