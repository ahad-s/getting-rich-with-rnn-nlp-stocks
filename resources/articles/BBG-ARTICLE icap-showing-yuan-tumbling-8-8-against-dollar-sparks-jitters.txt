Yuan investors -- already nervous about Donald Trump’s focus on China’s currency policy -- were in for a shock Tuesday when ICAP Plc data showed the currency had slipped to 7.5 per dollar.Google pricing showed yuan at 7.48 per dollar.The decline, which traders said was an error, showed up on both Google and Xe.com, causing a stir on Twitter, while Bloomberg showed no such moves. ICAP’s prices had the dollar-yuan at about 7.5 Tuesday even before the spot market started trading in Shanghai. Benny Luk, North Asia regional chief executive officer at ICAP (Hong Kong) Ltd., said by phone that he cannot confirm the price quote and that the firm is looking into it.“The U.S. dollar didn’t see a big move, and there’s been no particular news to trigger a sharp drop in the yuan,” said Aaron Chan, head of retail sales at ADS Securities Hong Kong Ltd. “The market is quite calm. If the yuan is really at 7.5, other asset classes should be very volatile. I think it’s probably a wrong price.”Xe.com showed wild move in yuan.The official exchange rate rose 0.24 percent to 6.8669 a dollar as of 11:20 a.m. in Shanghai, China Foreign Exchange Trade System prices show. The yuan traded in Hong Kong’s overseas market fell 0.1 percent to 6.8694, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.The yuan has come under increased pressure after Trump’s victory, with the Republican threatening to brand China a currency manipulator for allowing the exchange rate to weaken. The currency has tumbled 2.9 percent against the greenback this quarter as Trump’s win boosted the outlook for U.S. inflation and amid persistent Chinese capital outflows.
