NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Fitch Ratings has upgraded the rating of the senior and subordinate notes in the KeyCorp Student Loan Trust 2006-A (Group II). Fitch also affirmed the junior subordinate notes. The Rating Outlook for the senior and subordinate notes remains Stable. The Recovery Estimate for the junior subordinate note was increased to 35% from 15%.
A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release.
KEY RATING DRIVERS
Correction: The revised ratings are due to an input error from a recent annual surveillance review of the trust. During the annual review, the projected default rate was overestimated due to a miscalculation of the weighted average life caused by an input error. With the correction and recent updated improved trust performance, the ratings on the senior and subordinate notes are upgraded to be commensurate with their respective loss coverage multiples.
Collateral Quality: The trust is collateralized by approximately $235 million of private student loans originated by KeyBank under the Key Alternative Loan program, Campus Door program, Private Graduate program, Private Consolidation program and TERI program. The projected remaining defaults are expected be approximately 11% of the current pool balance. A recovery rate of 15% was applied based on historical and performance data.
Credit Enhancement (CE): CE is provided by overcollateralization, excess spread and subordination for the class A and B notes. Additionally, the trust can receive excess funds from its bifurcated KSLT 2006-A Group I Federal loan pool. As of the August 2016 servicer report, the parity ratios have increased since the last year from 183.7% to 236.3% for the class A notes, from 113.6% to 119.2% for the class B notes and from 96.40% to 96.74% for the class C notes (May 2015 - August 2016), respectively. The trust cannot release any excess cash until the class C parity reaches 104.5%.
Liquidity Support: Liquidity support for the trust is provided by a debt service reserve fund which is currently at $8.3 million, representing approximately 3.5% of the outstanding pool balance.
Servicing Capabilities: Day-to-day servicing is provided by KeyBank, N.A. Fitch believes the servicing operations are acceptable servicer of private student loans.
CRITERIA VARIATIONS
Eligible Investment: Under the 'Counterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds', dated Sept. 1, 2016, Fitch looks to its own ratings in analyzing counterparty risk and assessing a counterparty's creditworthiness. The definition of the permitted investments for this deal allows for the possibility of using investments that do not meet Fitch's criteria, this represents a criteria variation. Since the only available funds to invest are those held in the Collection Account, and the funds can only be invested for a short duration of three months given the payment frequency of the notes, Fitch does not believe such variation has a measurable impact upon the ratings assigned.
RATING SENSITIVITIES
As Fitch's base case default proxy is derived primarily from historical collateral performance, actual performance may differ from the expected performance, resulting in higher loss levels than the base case. This will result in a decline in CE and remaining loss coverage levels available to the bonds and may make certain bond ratings susceptible to potential negative rating actions, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage. Fitch will continue to monitor the performance of the trust.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.

A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein.

A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent).
