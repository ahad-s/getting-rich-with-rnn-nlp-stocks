Airbnb Inc. has set an automatic limit to the number of nights hosts can rent out their homes, at a time when the platform faces increasing pressure from cities and governments .
Hosts will now need a license to rent their homes in London for more than 90 days a year, and for 60 days a year in Amsterdam, according to statements from Airbnb Thursday.
The new rules strengthen existing guidelines set up in 2015. Airbnb will automatically limit home listings on its platform from 2017.
“We want to be good partners for everyone in [Amsterdam] and ensure home sharing grows responsibly and sustainably,” James McClure, Airbnb general manager for Northern Europe, said.
In Amsterdam, Airbnb will also promote a new tool for neighbors to share concerns about a home listing, including noise complaints. 
The San Fransisco-based company, which recently raised $555 million at a $30 billion valuation, has faced increasing pressure from city authorities, who are concerned the lodging-by-web platform is increasing the cost of living for residents.
“We have been in discussion with London Boroughs to understand their concerns about enforcing existing legislation and this move by Airbnb is a very positive and sensible step forward,” James Murray, deputy London mayor for housing and residential development, said in an emailed statement Thursday.
