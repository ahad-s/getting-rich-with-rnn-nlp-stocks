Workers remove an electoral poster of Yahya Jammeh, on a street of Bijil.Gambia President Yahya Jammeh said he no longer accepted the outcome of last week’s presidential vote in a sudden about-turn on a concession that he’ll step down after a defeat against opposition candidate Adama Barrow.Jammeh announced his “total rejection of the electoral results” as he addressed the West African nation Friday on state-owned television GRTS, citing voting irregularities. A new vote will be called for a later date, he said.Yahya Jammeh after voting on Dec 1. On Dec. 2, Jammeh said he would vacate the presidency after losing to Barrow in the previous day’s vote, signalling the end of a 22-year rule since coming to power through a coup in 1994. Criticized by human rights groups for brutally stifling dissent, Jammeh got landslide victories in four previous polls.The U.S. State Department condemned Jammeh’s decision.“This action is a reprehensible and unacceptable breach of faith with the people of The Gambia,” Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. It is “an egregious attempt to undermine a credible election process and remain in power illegitimately.”The reversal came after courts in Gambia granted bail to opposition leaders who were serving jail sentences for participating in protests against Jammeh’s rule earlier this year. Barrow already started laying out future policy over the past week, saying he’ll nurture new international relations and review economic plans in a country where thousands of young people are trying to emigrate each year.
