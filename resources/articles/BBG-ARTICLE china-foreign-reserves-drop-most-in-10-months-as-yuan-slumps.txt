China’s foreign currency reserves, the world’s largest, fell the most since January after the yuan declined to an eight-year low.The fifth-straight monthly decline brings the reduction in the stockpile to almost $1 trillion from a record $4 trillion in June 2014. While authorities have begun tightening capital controls, a $50,000 limit that Chinese citizens are allowed to convert from yuan annually will reset at the start of the new year, potentially adding depreciation pressure on the currency. "Containing capital outflows is the key to keeping China’s systematic risk in check," Harrison Hu, chief greater China economist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in Singapore, wrote in a note after the data. "Market turmoil one year earlier showed the strong feedback loop between capital flight and currency depreciation can destabilize China’s financial system and lead to escalating systemic risk.""The announcement of additional capital controls will smooth the fall in reserves for some time but won’t solve the problem," said Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Natixis SA in Hong Kong.
