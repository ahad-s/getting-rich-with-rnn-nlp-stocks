About NovaBay Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Going Beyond Antibiotics®
Avenova, formulated with Neutrox®, is cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a 510(k) medical device. Neutrox is NovaBay’s commercial name for its proprietary pure hypochlorous acid. Data from a multicenter clinical study show that Avenova reduced bacterial load, the underlying cause of blepharitis, on ocular skin surface by more than 90%. Laboratory tests show that hypochlorous acid has potent antimicrobial activity in solution yet is non-toxic to mammalian cells and also neutralizes bacterial toxins. Avenova is marketed to optometrists and ophthalmologists throughout the U.S. by NovaBay’s direct salesforce. It is accessible from more than 90% of retail pharmacies in the U.S. through agreements with McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health and AmeriSource Bergen.
