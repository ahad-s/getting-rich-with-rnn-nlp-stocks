A pickup truck is a light-duty vehicle that has an enclosed cab and an open cargo area with a tailgate. It can be either compact or full-size. Pickup trucks are mostly used as good carriers, but they also find application in personal transport, especially in the US, Mexico, and Brazil, among others. This can be attributed to rising demand for comfort and convenience, and modern pickup trucks are equipped with features such as Bluetooth connectivity, all-wheel drive (AWD), automatic transmissions, and DVD players, among others.
The report covers the present scenario and the growth prospects of the global pickup truck market for 2016-2020. To calculate the market size, the report presents the vendor landscape and a corresponding detailed analysis of the key vendors in the market.
One of latest trends in the market is emergence of electric pickup trucks. Electric vehicles have the capability to provide plenty of torque from a low revolutions per minute (RPM). This makes electric vehicles suitable for being used as a pickup truck because of fuel bill savings.
