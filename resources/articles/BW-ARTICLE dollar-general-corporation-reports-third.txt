GOODLETTSVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Dollar General Corporation (DG) today reported financial results for its fiscal 2016 third quarter (13 weeks) ended October 28, 2016.
“The challenging retail environment that we experienced in the 2016 second quarter continued into the third quarter, contributing to weakness in our same-store sales and our financial performance. In the 2016 third quarter, we invested in gross margin with the goal of driving traffic and sales over time. Many of these actions are gaining traction with our core customers, and we are encouraged by the early results. As expected, the full benefit on our same-store sales will not be immediate. In addition, we saw an acceleration in headwinds from average unit retail price deflation and reductions in SNAP benefits in the 2016 third quarter as compared to the 2016 second quarter. We are focused on efforts to drive traffic in our stores and to control the factors we can control as we look to overcome the issues impacting our results, many of which we believe are macroeconomic and transitory in nature,” said Todd Vasos, Dollar General’s chief executive officer.
“We continue to believe that our business model is strong given our value proposition to our consumers. We are investing in accelerated new store growth with excellent returns, as well as the infrastructure to support this growth, while continuing to return cash to shareholders."
Third Quarter Highlights
The Company reported net income of $235 million, or $0.84 per diluted share, in the 2016 third quarter, compared to net income of $253 million, or $0.86 per diluted share, in the 2015 third quarter.
Net sales increased 5.0 percent to $5.32 billion in the 2016 third quarter compared to $5.07 billion in the 2015 third quarter. Same-store sales decreased 0.1 percent from the 2015 third quarter primarily due to a decline in traffic partially offset by an increase in average transaction amount. Same-store sales were driven by positive results in the consumables category offset by negative results in the seasonal, apparel and home products categories. The net sales increase was positively affected by sales from new stores, modestly offset by sales from closed stores.
Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 29.8 percent in the 2016 third quarter, a decrease of 49 basis points from the 2015 third quarter. The gross profit rate decrease was primarily attributable to higher markdowns, driven mainly by inventory clearance and promotional activities, a greater proportion of sales of consumables, and increased inventory shrink, partially offset by higher initial inventory markups.
Selling, general and administrative expense (“SG&A”), as a percentage of net sales, was 22.5 percent in the 2016 third quarter compared to 22.0 percent in the 2015 third quarter, an increase of 48 basis points. The SG&A increase was primarily attributable to increased retail labor and occupancy costs. The 2016 third quarter also included charges of $13.0 million, or 25 basis points, associated with the acquisition of the former Walmart Express store locations and related closure of existing stores, $11.0 million of which was for lease termination and other exit and disposal costs. In addition, the Company experienced an increase in disaster-related expenses of $7.7 million, or 14 basis points, most of which were hurricane related. Partially offsetting these items were reductions in administrative payroll costs, incentive compensation expenses and advertising expenses. The 2015 period reflects expenses of $6.1 million related to a corporate restructuring for severance-related benefit costs.
The effective income tax rate was 36.2 percent for the 2016 third quarter compared to a rate of 37.0 percent for the 2015 third quarter. The effective income tax rate was lower in the 2016 third quarter due primarily to the recognition of additional amounts of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (“WOTC”) in the 2016 third quarter. The December 2015 reenactment of the WOTC allowed the Company to receive credits for eligible employees hired during the third quarter of 2016. By comparison, in the 2015 third quarter, only a limited number of employees (hired on or before December 31, 2014) were eligible for the credit.
39-Week Period Results
For the 39-week period ended October 28, 2016, net sales increased 5.9 percent over the comparable 2015 period to $15.98 billion. Same-store sales increased 0.9 percent compared to the corresponding 2015 period. An increase in average transaction amount was the primary contributor to the increase in same-store sales. The remainder of the net sales increase was attributable to sales from new stores, modestly offset by sales from closed stores.
Gross profit increased by 5.6 percent and, as a percentage of net sales, decreased by 10 basis points to 30.6 percent in the 2016 39-week period compared to the comparable 2015 period. The majority of the gross profit rate decrease in the 2016 period as compared to the 2015 period was due to higher markdowns, driven mainly by promotional activities and inventory clearance, a greater proportion of sales of consumables, and increased inventory shrink, partially offset by higher inventory initial markups and lower transportation costs, partially attributable to lower fuel rates.
SG&A rounded to 21.9 percent of net sales in both the 2016 and 2015 periods, increasing by 5 basis points in the 2016 period. The SG&A increase was primarily attributable to increased retail labor and occupancy costs. As noted above, the 2016 period included lease termination and other expenses related to the acquired Walmart Express stores and disaster-related expenses. Partially offsetting these items were reductions in administrative payroll costs, incentive compensation, and advertising costs. The 2015 period reflects expenses of $6.1 million related to a corporate restructuring for severance-related benefit costs.
The effective income tax rate for the 2016 period was 36.1 percent compared to a rate of 37.6 percent for the 2015 period. The effective income tax rate was lower in the 2016 period due primarily to the recognition of additional amounts of the WOTC and the Company’s early adoption of an amended accounting standard for employee share-based payments. The December 2015 reenactment of the WOTC allowed the Company to receive credits for eligible employees hired during the 2016 period. By comparison, in the 2015 period, only a limited number of employees (hired on or before December 31, 2014) were eligible for the credit.
For the 2016 39-week period, the Company reported net income of $837 million, or $2.95 per diluted share, compared to net income of $789 million, or $2.65 per diluted share, for the 2015 39-week period.
Merchandise Inventories
As of October 28, 2016, total merchandise inventories, at cost, were $3.49 billion compared to $3.10 billion as of October 30, 2015, an increase of 5.6 percent on a per-store basis. The increase was concentrated in everyday planogram categories as compared to seasonally-related categories. Key factors impacting the increase in per store inventory were the Company’s on-shelf availability initiative and the timing of receipts, coupled with sales performance.
Capital Expenditures
Total additions to property and equipment in the 39-week period ended October 28, 2016 were $406 million, including: $136 million for distribution and transportation-related capital expenditures; $116 million for improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; $92 million related to new leased stores, primarily for leasehold improvements, fixtures and equipment; $38 million for stores purchased or built by the Company and $18 million for information systems upgrades and technology-related projects. During the 2016 39-week period, the Company opened 768 new stores and remodeled or relocated 861 stores.
Share Repurchases
During the 2016 third quarter, the Company repurchased 2.9 million shares of its common stock under its share repurchase program at an average price of $77.18 per share. For the 2016 39-week period, the Company repurchased 8.2 million shares of its common stock under the share repurchase program at an average price of $83.24 per share. Since the inception of the share repurchase program in December 2011 through the end of the 2016 third quarter, the Company has repurchased 70.2 million shares totaling $4.3 billion, at an average price of $60.65 per share. The total remaining authorization for future repurchases was approximately $1.2 billion at the end of the 2016 third quarter. The authorization has no expiration date.
Dividend
On November 30, 2016, the Board of Directors declared its regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share on the Company’s common stock. The fourth quarter dividend will be payable on January 4, 2017 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 21, 2016.
Financial Outlook
On March 10, 2016, the Company stated that it intended to update its diluted EPS guidance for the 53-weeks ending February 3, 2017 (“fiscal 2016”) only if the Company no longer reasonably expects diluted EPS to fall within the 10 percent to 15 percent range outlined in the long-term growth model included in its press release issued on that date. The Company now forecasts diluted EPS growth for fiscal 2016 to be at the low end of the Company’s long-term growth model range of 10 percent to 15 percent. The Company expects the 53rd week to contribute approximately 200 basis points to its net sales performance and continues to estimate a $0.09 per diluted share impact to EPS.
As stated in the March 10, 2016 press release, the Company does not intend, and specifically disclaims any duty, to update its expectations regarding where in the range of guidance fiscal 2016 net sales, same-store sales or diluted EPS may fall, or to update any component of the growth model outlined in that press release, other than the diluted EPS range as specified herein. However, the Company does intend to discuss square footage growth from time to time. For the 52-week period ending February 2, 2018 (“fiscal 2017”), the Company plans to increase square footage growth by approximately 7.5 percent with the opening of approximately 1,000 new stores in addition to remodeling or relocating 900 stores.
The Company continues to use the long-term growth model outlined in its March 10, 2016 press release in discussions of its business, and by doing so the Company does not undertake to update any portion of the growth model. In any given year, one or more key drivers of the model may be outside of the annual targets outlined in such model.
