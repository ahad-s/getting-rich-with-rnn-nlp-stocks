“The big data and VDI revolution are driving new requirements for our customers, and pushes the limits of our design team,” said Dr. Charles Tsai, President of AccelStor, “By broadening our software functionality, including new tools for VDI environments, we’re determined to be the go-to solution for any I/O intensive storage applications.”
A New Level of Storage Performance
Supported by FlexiRemap Technology, the NeoSapphire P710 all-flash array boasts the highest IOPS of the series – over 700K IOPS for 4KB random write, an over 16% increase from its predecessor, the NeoSapphire 3413. The P710 comes with 11TB or 23TB usable capacity and adopts the same rack-mount 2U form factor, storing up to 24 hot-swappable enterprise SSDs including 2 global hot spares. This new generation of all-flash arrays supports both 10GbE and 16G Fibre Channel connectivity for blazing-fast throughput.
Snapshots for Software-Level Protection
With the P710, NeoSapphire users can now quickly and seamlessly recover their data to particular instances through its snapshot function. The scheduled snapshot and the associated restore feature can have data backed up by remote storage for extra security. By quickly reverting to previous storage states, users can be assured that their data is protected, even on top of the high level of existing redundancy.
Brand New Tools for VDI Applications
AccelStor’s special Free Clone function allows users to cut down on time-consuming volume cloning for VDI applications without allocating a physical capacity. AccelStor’s new vSphere Web Client Plug-in provides easy management for VMware administrators who can create, delete, and clone datastores in the integrated GUI, without needing to access the main web UI. Users can choose to enable thin provisioning or thick provisioning for greater flexibility when creating virtual disks. P710 is also certified for VAAI Block as VMware Ready Storage
Rock-Solid Reliability and Redundancy
All 24 SSDs in the NeoSapphire P710 are hot-swappable; 2 of these SSDs are hot spares for redundancy. In tandem with the new snapshot backup feature, this level of fault tolerance ensures that data is protected and always recoverable.
The 10GbE SKU of the NeoSapphire P710 is presently ready with available samples for customer evaluation. The Fibre Channel SKU will be available in January 2017. For product details and specifications, visit the NeoSapphire P710 product page: https://www.accelstor.com/overview.php?id=19
