TOKYO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Mitsubishi Electric Corporation (TOKYO:6503) announced today it will exhibit 17 universal-design products that offer maximized ease of use and accessibility for people of all ages and abilities, during the 6th International Conference for Universal Design at the Nagoya Congress Center in Nagoya, Japan from December 9 to December 11. The exhibits will range from consumer electronics to industrial products.
Mitsubishi Electricâ€™s universal design initiatives are based on the concept of usability for each individual, aiming to make products accessible to the largest number of people possible. In recent years, the need for such products has been growing fueled by aging societies and evolving work environments, prompting Mitsubishi Electric to broaden the scope of its universal design initiatives beyond the consumer-electronics and public-facility sectors to include industrial products as well.
About the International Conference for Universal Design
Universal design is the purposeful designing of products, buildings, and public/private environments to enable access and usage by the greatest possible number of people, irrespective of ethnicity, culture, customs, nationality, gender, age or ability. The International Universal Design Declaration, released at the First International Conference for Universal Design in Yokohama, Japan in 2002, referred to universal design as the creation of the social environments that respect and support the dignity of humans.
