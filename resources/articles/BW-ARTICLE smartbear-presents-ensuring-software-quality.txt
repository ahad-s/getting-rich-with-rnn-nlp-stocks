SOMERVILLE, Mass. & ORLANDO, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Rick Almeida, Development Team Lead, Collaborator at SmartBear Software, the leader in software quality tools for teams, is presenting, “VST12 Ensuring Quality Deliverables with SmartBear’s Visual Studio Integrations,” at Visual Studio Live!, taking place on Monday, December 5 – Friday, December 9, 2016 in Orlando, Florida. SmartBear is also exhibiting its development and testing tools that integrate with Visual Studio, helping companies and teams to produce high quality software more quickly and with more efficiency, in booth #116.
Rick Almeida walks attendees through a live presentation of SmartBear’s approach to quality, providing a glimpse into modern API and GUI testing best practices and how the company delivers software using its own tools. High quality software starts before you start writing code. Rick talks about how SmartBear collaborates on requirements across its extended development team, translates those requirements into code and finally code reviews and test plans. Also on the agenda is a quick look into root cause analysis via code profiling, because no one likes memory leaks or slow applications. Whether you’re a QA professional, a developer or a product owner, SmartBear’s tools maximize quality while minimizing effort.
SmartBear is demonstrating Collaborator, the leading peer code and document review tool that helps development, testing and management teams work together to produce high quality code, applications and services.
