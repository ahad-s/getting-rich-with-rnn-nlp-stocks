The Chinese gambling enclave of Macau extended gaming revenue gains in November, posting the strongest growth in almost three years and advancing a recovery that’s seen more visitors flock to new resort openings in the world’s largest gaming hub.
Gross gaming revenue rose 14.4 percent to 18.8 billion patacas ($2.4 billion), according to Macau’s Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau. That compares with the median estimate for an 11 percent advance in a Bloomberg survey of nine analysts. It is the fourth straight month of gains and the strongest year-on-year  growth since February 2014.

“Visitation is starting to grow again and more importantly, people are staying longer,” said Marcus Liu, a gaming analyst at CLSA Ltd, before the release. The strong growth is also due to the low base, as November 2015 posted the worst performance in five years, he said.
The $30 billion gaming industry in Macau, the only place in China where casinos are legal, has rebounded since August as operators opened new, billion-dollar resorts. Casino operators in the Chinese special administrative region have turned to attracting the more lucrative market of families and casual gamblers amid President Xi Jinping’s efforts to curb official corruption and limit capital outflow that chased away high-stakes players who accounted for the bulk of bets.
