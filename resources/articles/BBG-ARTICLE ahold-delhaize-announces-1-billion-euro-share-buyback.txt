Royal Ahold Delhaize NV announced plans to buy back 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) of shares and will plow money into online expansion as its cash reserves swell following the merger of the Dutch and Belgian retailers.The company aims to double online sales by 2020 from 2.3 billion euros expected for this year, the Netherlands-based company said Wednesday ahead of an investor presentation. Free cash flow should increase to about 1.6 billion euros in 2017 from the 1.3 billion euros forecast for this year, the company also said. The stock rose as much as 1.9 percent in Amsterdam.“A hallmark of Ahold is that it generates lots of free cash flow,” Joost van Beek, an analyst at Theodoor Gilissen Bankiers, said by phone.The supermarket operator reported third-quarter earnings below analysts’ estimates last month as deflation hurt Food Lion grocery stores in the U.S., its slowest-growing market. Ahold and Delhaize merged in July to confront heightened competition from retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc.The company reiterated its forecast that the merger will lead to annual savings of 500 million euros in 2019. Ahold suspended a longstanding buyback program when it announced the tie-up last year.
