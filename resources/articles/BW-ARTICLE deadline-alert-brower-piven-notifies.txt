STEVENSON, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
The securities litigation law firm of Brower Piven, A Professional Corporation, announces that a class action lawsuit has been commenced in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado on behalf of purchasers of Pilgrim’s Pride Corporation (PPC) (“Pilgrim’s Pride” or the “Company”) securities during the period between February 21, 2014 and October 6, 2016, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors who wish to become proactively involved in the litigation have until December 19, 2016 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff.
If you wish to choose counsel to represent you and the Class, you must apply to be appointed lead plaintiff and be selected by the Court. The lead plaintiff will direct the litigation and participate in important decisions including whether to accept a settlement for the Class in the action. The lead plaintiff will be selected from among applicants claiming the largest loss from investment in Pilgrim’s Pride securities during the Class Period. Members of the Class will be represented by the lead plaintiff and counsel chosen by the lead plaintiff. No class has yet been certified in the above action.
The complaint accuses the defendants of violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by virtue of the defendants’ failure to disclose during the Class Period that the Company systematically colluded with several of its industry peers to fix prices in the market for broiler chickens, which constituted a violation of federal antitrust laws, and that Pilgrim’s revenues during the class period were the result of the illegal conduct.
According to the complaint, following a September 2, 2016 filing of an antitrust class action complaint by Maplevale Farms, Inc. alleging that Pilgrim and other companies conspired to manipulate prices, and an October 7, 2016 downgrade by Pivotal Research from “Hold” to “Sell” due to the lawsuit and the allegations, the value of Pilgrim shares declined significantly.
If you have suffered a loss in excess of $100,000 from investment in Pilgrim’s Pride securities purchased on or after February 21, 2014 and held through the revelation of negative information during and/or at the end of the Class Period and would like to learn more about this lawsuit and your ability to participate as a lead plaintiff, without cost or obligation to you, please visit our website at http://www.browerpiven.com/currentsecuritiescases.html.
