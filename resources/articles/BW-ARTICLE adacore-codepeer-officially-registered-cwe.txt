NEW YORK & PARIS & SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Embedded Systems Conference - AdaCore today announced that its CodePeer advanced static analysis tool for Ada has been formally designated as “CWE-Compatible” by the MITRE Corporation’s Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) Compatibility and Effectiveness Program. This program is a web-based initiative that consolidates and organizes information about cyber-security products and services.
“It’s a great achievement to have CodePeer officially recognized as CWE compatible, which confirms that the tool can detect the most frequent types of software vulnerability,” said Arnaud Charlet, AdaCore Technical Director and CodePeer Product Manager. “CodePeer’s deep analysis of Ada code supports a wide range of uses including coding standard checking, automated code review, and exhaustive detection of certain CWE weaknesses as well as other kinds of error.”
CodePeer was recognized as CWE-Compatible based on its ability to detect the following code weaknesses, which are among the CWE’s Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Errors:
A number of other CWE weaknesses are also detected by CodePeer:
About CodePeer
CodePeer is an Ada source code analyzer that detects run-time and logic errors. It assesses potential bugs before program execution, serving as an automated peer reviewer, helping to find errors efficiently and early in the development life-cycle. It can also be used to perform impact analysis when introducing changes to the existing code, as well as helping vulnerability analysis for legacy systems. Using control-flow, data-flow, and other advanced static analysis techniques, CodePeer detects errors that would otherwise only be found through labor-intensive debugging.
The tool’s deep analysis can directly support formal certification against industry-specific safety standards. For avionics applications CodePeer has been qualified as a Software Verification Tool under DO-178B, automating a number of verification activities defined in paragraph 6.3.4f (“Accuracy and consistency”). These activities include detecting errors such as values outside the bounds of an Ada type or subtype, buffer overflows, integer overflow or wraparound, division by zero, use of uninitialized variables, and floating point underflow.
CodePeer has also been qualified for EN 50128, the highest international standard for safety integrity concerning software for railway control and protection, including communications, signaling and processing systems. The EN 50128 qualification material addresses the following:
Qualification materials for DO-178B and EN 50128 are available as an option with CodePeer.
CodePeer is fully integrated into AdaCore’s GNAT Pro development environment and comes with a number of complementary static analysis tools common to the technology – a coding standard verification tool (GNATcheck), a source code metric generator (GNATmetric) and a document generator.
