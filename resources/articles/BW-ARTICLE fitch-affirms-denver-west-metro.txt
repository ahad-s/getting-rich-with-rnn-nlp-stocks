AUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'A-' rating on the following bonds of Denver West Metropolitan District, CO:
--$51.8 million in outstanding general obligation (GO) bonds.
Fitch has also withdrawn the district's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) due to a lack of operating risk.
The Rating Outlook is Stable.
SECURITY
The bonds are payable from an unlimited ad valorem tax levied against all taxable property within the district.
KEY RATING DRIVERS
The district's revenue base is narrow with stagnant growth prospects. Operations are minimal, reflecting the limited purpose of the district which was formed for the primary purpose of financing infrastructure improvements. The liability burden is high though remaining capital needs are limited.
Economic Resource Base
The district is located primarily in the city of Lakewood, approximately 10 miles west of downtown Denver. The district encompasses approximately 516 acres and serves a predominantly commercial tax base with a modest residential population of about 1,100.
Dedicated Revenue Stream
Growth prospects for tax revenues are stagnant absent policy action and the tax base is concentrated. However, the district's debt service tax rate is unlimited, providing significant credit strength. The unlimited nature of the tax provides significant cushion against potential tax base decline and helps offset concern about tax base volatility.
Long-Term Liability Burden
The overall debt burden is high in relation to the resource base and direct debt amortizes slowly. The district has no liabilities for retiree benefits.
Lack of Operating Risk
The district's operating responsibilities are minimal and are therefore not a significant credit factor.
RATING SENSITIVITIES
Tax Base Key Factor: Significant and sustained improvement in the district's tax base over time, accompanied by diversification, would improve revenue prospects and support higher rating consideration. The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that this is unlikely during the current review period.
Reduced Liability Burden: A material reduction in the district's long-term liability burden could result in positive rating consideration.
CREDIT PROFILE
The district was organized in 1984 to provide infrastructure for commercial, retail, and residential development. It is located adjacent to Interstate Highway 70, which is the primary east/west route through the Denver MSA and the state. Major components of the Denver West development include a regional shopping mall and a 1.4 million-square foot office park. Other major properties include a hotel, two strip centers, owner-occupied office buildings, and three apartment complexes (about 750 total units). Retail and multifamily occupancy rates are consistently high; office occupancy rates are lower, but the district's developer anticipates improvement as the result of a recent marketing campaign.
The top 10 taxpayers account for a very high 55% of 2016 assessed valuation (AV). The top payer is Colorado Mills Mall at 22% of AV, and is owned by Simon Property Group (IDR 'A'/Stable). Prospects for increased taxpayer diversity are minimal given the small size and relative maturity of the district.
Dedicated Revenue Stream
Debt service is paid from an unlimited property tax. Therefore, Fitch uses AV as a proxy for revenues in its assessment of growth prospects. District taxable values exhibit compounded annual growth at a slower pace than inflation over the 10 years ended in 2015. Tax base growth prospects for the district remain stagnant, though the developer anticipates some redevelopment activity over the medium term. The rating recognizes the risk inherent in the narrow tax base dominated by the commercial real estate sector.
AV experienced a recessionary decline of 14.6% in fiscal years 2010-2012. However, tax rates are adjusted annually to ensure sufficient revenues for full GO bond repayment.
The district also levies an unlimited property tax for capital outlay and its minimal operations. District management has historically kept the total mill levy rate for operations and debt service at or below 35 mills in order to maintain competitive appeal; the total rate for 2016 is 35 mills.
Long-Term Liability Burden
The district's overall debt burden is high at 12% of market value, and is largely attributable to direct debt. The liability burden is a substantial 116% of personal income due to the very small residential component of the primarily commercial district. Fitch expects the burden to remain high given slow amortization of direct debt and anticipated overlapping debt issuance. The district has no near-term debt plans and does not provide pensions or other postemployment benefits.
Lack of Operating Risk
General fund expenditures are modest and consist primarily of capital outlay and transfers to Lena Gulch Metropolitan District (the operating district) pursuant to an intergovernmental agreement. The district and Lena Gulch share a board of directors and management team. Modest operating costs and capital expenditures can be adjusted during periods of economic stress. The district has no employees, as most services are contracted out.

Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete.

As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.
