Standing Rock Sioux’s Tribal Chairman asked protesters camped near the site of the Dakota Access oil pipeline to return to their homes following the Obama administration’s decision to block the line.
The 1,172-mile (1,886-kilometer) pipeline remains stalled after the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Sunday cited the need to explore alternate routes and potentially conduct an environmental review. President-elect Donald Trump’s team has said he supports construction of the pipeline and will review the Corps decision when he takes office.
"We have a huge victory we need to celebrate," Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault II said in a video posted to Twitter. "Regardless of the new administration, they can’t overturn that overnight."
The battle now will move to the legal front, he said in an e-mailed statement. Protesters should leave the site as a winter storm approaches and he urged opponents not to resort to any illegal actions against the project. "It’s time to go home," he said.
