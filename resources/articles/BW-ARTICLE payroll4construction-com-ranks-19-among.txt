STRONGSVILLE, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
The official Weatherhead 100 list released last week places Payroll4Construction.com (P4C), a payroll processing and reporting service specifically for the construction industry, 19th among the 100 fastest-growing companies in Northeast Ohio. This is the company’s second consecutive year in the top 25%.
“We started Payroll4Construction.com because there was a need for the service in the construction industry,” said P4C president Mike Ode. “What we’re seeing in growth is a response to that, and we have a vision to see it continue at a pace that lets us partner with each client to give their business the attention they deserve. Above all, we’re grateful to our clients, and we want to keep showing that gratitude.”
Just eight years after running its first client payroll, P4C now has over 1,000 clients across the U.S. “We’re looking at a market that’s wide open for our services, and as we keep maturing as a company, we’re going to keep growing into those opportunities.”
Based out of Case Western Reserve University’s Weatherhead School of Management, the Weatherhead 100 recognizes Northeast Ohio-based companies with outstanding sales growth over four years. P4C was honored at a black-tie event on December 1 at the Hilton Downtown Cleveland, where the rankings were announced.
