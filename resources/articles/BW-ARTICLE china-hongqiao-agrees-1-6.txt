China Hongqiao Group Ltd., the subject of allegations by an anonymous short-seller, said it would take control of foil-maker Loften Environmental Technology Co. for about $1.6 billion.
The nation’s biggest aluminum smelter is bolstering its expansion beyond primary metal production by adding to its earlier purchase of Loften shares. In August, the Zouping-based company had agreed to buy 28 percent of Loften for as much as 900 million yuan ($131 million). It will now boost that stake to 74 percent at an additional cost of 10 billion yuan, according to a statement from Hongqiao on Tuesday.
Loften’s value will increase via its own purchase of aluminum alloy processor Shandong Innovative Metal Technology Co. from Binzhou Hengwang Shareholding Management Corp., in a separate deal worth 7 billion yuan, according to the statement.

The acquisitions “will play a very important role in enhancing the group’s position in the area of aluminum deep processing through industrial integration and also bring positive impact to the group’s production and operation,” Hongqiao said.
The company said last month it’s preparing an announcement to rebut and clarify the anonymous claims made on the Hongqiao Exposed website, which question the firm’s cash flow, debt load, alleged undisclosed related-party transactions, and its environmental record. In an initial rejection of the allegations, Hongqiao called the report “one-sided, misleading and speculative.”
