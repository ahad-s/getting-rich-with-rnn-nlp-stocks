DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Click and Collect in the UK" report to their offering.
The Click and Collect in the UK report offers a comprehensive insight into online fulfillment in the UK, analyzing the market, the major players, the main trends, and consumer attitudes. It also provides forecasts to 2021.
Click and collect is forecast to grow by 64% between 2016 and 2021, driven by the clothing and footwear sector (growth of 85%) as increasingly time-poor consumers are looking to reduce time spent shopping.
Although a relatively small part of overall category expenditure, click and collect spending in furniture and floor coverings will grow significantly between 2016 and 2021 with an increase of 271.8% making it by far the fastest-growing category.
Key Findings
- Those aged between 35-44 have the highest penetration in click and collect purchases; often recent homeowners, these consumers are highly influenced by stylish online platforms that help to visualize home style looks.
- The usage share for laptops and desktops has declined from the previous year while click and collect products purchased via a mobile saw an increase, to reach 14.4%. This reflects retailers' investment in mobile apps and optimizing websites.
- 43.7% of consumers have used click and collect in order to avoid delivery charges, as home delivery proves to be too costly for consumers, particularly for low-value items. Retailers wanting to avoid fulfillment charges have opted to add a minimum spend threshold to their free click and collect service to make it more profitable.
- With congested shops and long queues reducing consumers' shopping experience, many consumers opt for click and collect to reduce time spent in stores - and 34.7% of male click and collect shoppers opted to use this service for that reason.
