IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Pat Mercuri, President and Founder of Managed Direct Response, announced today that the company is launching a number of direct mail products to target the reverse mortgage market. They are designed to effectively allow mortgage brokers to reach the Boomer market in a compelling way.
“We see the reverse mortgage market as a great opportunity. Over 10,000 Baby Boomers turn 65 every day. Reverse mortgages were stagnant after the last recession but are having a quiet comeback due to low interest rates and to the fact that stock portfolios haven’t recovered,” said Mercuri. “Many Baby Boomers are house-rich but cash poor.”
According to John Salter, a financial planning professor at Texas Tech, reverse mortgages make a lot of sense now because home equity can be a big part of a person’s net worth.
A combination of lower costs and better consumer protection is encouraging some financial planners to start recommending them.
According to the New York Times reverse mortgages are making a comeback and seen to be helping some retirees fill gaps in their future income. They can provide cash or longevity insurance when other sources of retirement income come up short or they can provide money for out-of-pocket health care costs or other sudden financial crunches.
“The key to effectively reaching the Baby Boomer market is targeting and messaging. It is not as simple as targeting affluent zip codes. We bring more insight into the process. Messaging is key. The creative clichés of the past such as smiling seniors in rocking chairs don’t cut it today,” said Mercuri.
“We offer a fully integrated one stop solution and provide our customers with a suite of solutions from the best data, to compelling creative, in house production and the lowest mailing costs.”
