DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Strategic Analysis of the Global 48v Power-net Market" report to their offering.
OEMs are looking for various means to reduce the CO2 emissions required for 2020 and 2025. The 12v power-net can no longer sustain the electrical load that present day top-end vehicles use.
Any new addition to the electrical load will require an increase of the power-net capacity. Therefore, OEMs are considering migrating to a 48v power-net, thereby using 2 voltages.
The 48v power-net also manages to reduce vehicle weight, thereby reducing fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. Heavy-duty functions are expected to port to the new 48v power-net.
The study will answer several key questions:
