DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Electric Power Outlook 2017: New Opportunities amid an Uneven Recovery" report to their offering.
The Electric Power Outlook for 2017 uses data from the major energy publications, interviews with industry insiders and analysts, information from companies and governments, along with its own in-house content to provide the reader a picture of where the electric power industry is headed in Latin America next year. The report includes graphs and tables illustrating the major trends in the industry.
Activity in the Latin American power industry has not stagnated. The region is bringing new capacity online and expanding, sometimes belatedly, its electrical grids to accommodate the new generators. Renewable energy sources, wind and solar in particular, continue to break new ground and will likely be a major focus on the 2017 energy agenda's of many Latin American governments.
Readers of the report include companies interested or involved in electricity in Latin America, government agencies, NGOs and analysts in the field. Information is provided on all the participants in the report should further information be required.
Most outlooks cautiously predict that economies in Latin America and the Caribbean will begin to gradually pick up in 2017. This should provide a boost to electricity demand, which closely tracks the region's economic health, but the recovery is likely to be uneven, given that certain countries have fared far worse than others. Even as electricity consumption has cooled off in the last few years, activity in the Latin American power industry has not stagnated.
